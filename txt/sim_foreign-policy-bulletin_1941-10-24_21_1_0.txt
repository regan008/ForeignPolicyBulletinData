months in Tokyo. The third Konoye Cabinet, just 
ousted, also sought to tide over a difficult period by 
negotiations when a German victory in Russia was 
delayed and Anglo-American-Dutch trade sanctions 
countered the advance into southern Indo-China. 
The second Konoye Cabinet, on the other hand, 
was formed in July 1940 on the basis of expectations 
that the collapse of France would speedily lead to 
an Axis victory over England. It forced the closing 
of the Burma Road, moved into northern Indo-China, 
and concluded the Axis-Japan pact. When the hoped- 
for invasion of Britain failed to materialize, how- 
ever, Japan’s southward drive was halted. Consid- 
erable criticism was expressed at that time in the 
more extreme Japanese military-naval circles, which 
felt that Konoye had missed a “golden opportunity” 
by not pushing resolutely forward into Southeast 
Asia while the defenses of Singapore and the Dutch

ARGENTINE TRADE AGREEMENT STRENGTHENS GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY 


On October 14, after prolonged negotiations, the 
United States and Argentina signed a new trade and 
commercial agreement designed to replace the 1853 
Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. 
Hailed by President Roosevelt as an “outstanding 
contribution” to the reconstruction of trade, the ac- 
cord should help substantially in cementing politi- 
cal and economic relations with Argentina, the 
country which has remained most skeptical of the 
value of the Good Neighbor policy. 

The successful conclusion of the agreement at 
this time is in sharp contrast to the collapse of previ- 
ous negotiations in January 1940. During the past 
eighteen months United States trade with Argen- 
tina has grown rapidly. Direct and indirect defense 
needs have greatly stimulated purchases of Argen- 
tine hides and skins, wool and other raw materials. 
In addition, the U.S. has bought increased quanti- 
ties of fruit, cheese, wine and casein, some of which 
formerly came from Europe. As a result, U.S. im- 
ports from Argentina rose from $61,914,000 in 
1939 to $83,301,000 in 1940; and in the first seven 
months of 1941 they soared to $96,000,000 as com- 
pared with $51,000,000 in the corresponding period 
of the previous year. Exports to Argentina increased

from $70,945,000 in 1939 to $106,874,000, but in 
the first seven months of 1941 they dropped to| 
$47,000,000, thus giving the Argentines an export 
surplus in its trade with the U.S. for the first time | 
since the drought year of 1937, when we purchased | 
large quantities of Argentine feedstuffs. The expan- | 
sion of trade with the U.S. has enabled Argentina 
to compensate largely for the loss of its continental 
European market. Although still saddled with large, 
unexportable surpluses of corn, wheat and other 
grain, Argentina managed to confine the fall in the 
global value of its exports to 9.2 per cent in 1940; | 
and its total sales in the first eight months of 1941 
were actually somewhat higher than in the same 
period of 1938. Circumstances were therefore more 
favorable to the negotiation of a commercial agree. 
ment with the United States. 


U.S. CONCESSIONS. In the new accord, which | 
becomes provisionally effective on November 15, | 
the U.S. furnishes Argentina with additional oppor- 
tunities to offset its trade losses in the European 
market. This country lowers its duties on items ) 
which made up 64.2 per cent of our imports from 
Argentina in 1939 and 44.5 per cent in 1940. The 
most important concessions are the tariff reduction 
on flaxseed from 65c. to 32.5c. per bushel; the slash 
of 50 per cent in the duties on fresh apples, pears, 
grapes, plums and prunes, which is limited to the sea- 
son when little U.S. produce comes on the market; | 
the reduction by one-half of the duties on bovine | 
hides and skins, quebracho extract and casein; and 
the lowering of rates on Italian-type cheeses, maca- 
roni, noodles and similar alimentary pastes formerly

imported from Italy. The duty on canned meat, pri- 
marily corned beef, is cut from 6c. to 3c. per pound; 
and although a minimum ad valorem rate of 20 
er cent is retained, increased imports of canned 
beef should be possible, since the 6c. duty was 

uivalent in 1939 to an ad valorem rate of 60 per 
cent. In addition, the U.S. has agreed to lower du- 
ties on certain coarse wools, to freeze existing rates 
on a number of products including brandy, liqueurs 
and wines, and to maintain others on the free list. 


The U.S. has hedged its concessions with a num- 
ber of safeguards which will enable it to recover its 
freedom when more normal trade has been re- 
established. The flaxseed duty, for example, can be 
raised to 50 cents thirty days after the President 
finds that the ‘‘abnormal” trade situation in that 
product has ceased to exist. Moreover, after the war 
all concessions will be subject to modification or 
termination by the U.S. on six months’ notice. 


U.S. PRODUCTS BENEFITED. In return, Ar- 
gentina has conferred tariff advantages on a long 
list of agricultural and industrial products account- 
ing for $32,106,000, or 30.2 per cent, of the value of 
U.S. exports to that country in 1940. Reductions are 
granted on goods constituting $19,354,000 of our 
1940 sales, and duties are bound on the remainder. 
Seasonal reductions on fresh fruits and those on 
certain industrial products such as trucks, delivery 
cars and bus chassis are effective immediately. In the 
case of most manufaciures, however, the new tariff 
tates will become applicable in whole or in part 
only when Argentina’s customs revenue, which in 
1940 amounted to 230 million pesos, again reaches 
the level of 270 million per year. Moreover, there is 
no definite assurance that Argentina will set aside 
the necessary foreign exchange for the purchase of 
a larger volume of American goods, although it has 
agreed not to discriminate in the allocation of for- 
eign exchange and has improved its exchange treat- 
ment of imports from the U.S. since last June. Most 
of Argentina’s exports to the sterling area, notably 
Britain, are paid in “blocked sterling.” The U.S. 
has, therefore, waived the right to insist on the abo- 
lition of preferential exchange allotments to import- 
ers from that area. In addition, this country has 
agreed to forego the benefit of tariff concessions 
granted by Argentina to its neighbors and to Peru. 


The practical economic effect of the new agree- 
ment is difficult to appraise in view of the uncertain 
operation of some of its provisions and the ab- 
normal conditions prevailing in international trade.

While the accord in theory enables Argentina to in- 
crease substantially its sales to the U.S., the shipping 
shortage in the north-bound trades of Latin America 
will seriously limit these possibilities in practice. At 
the same time, our defense program continues to cur- 
tail exports of U.S. machinery, iron and steel and 
other products to Latin America. Undoubtedly the 
political significance of the agreement will far out- 
weigh its economic value. It constitutes a testimonial 
of Washington’s good faith and should reinforce the 
influence of the U.S. in Argentina. Its political ef- 
fect may be transitory, however, if shipping and 
priority difficulties seriously handicap the develop- 
ment of trade relations. Nor does the new agreement 
entirely remove Argentina’s fear that the U.S. may 
again reduce its purchases to previous low levels 


once the war is over. JouN C. pEWILDE

Washington News Letter 


WASHINGTON BUREAU 
National Press Building 

Oct. 20.—The recent announcement that the State 
Department has created a Board of Economic Opera- 
tions, composed of ten ranking officials, deserves 
greater attention than it has yet received in the press. 
On the one hand, it affords another example of the 
growing importance of economic warfare as an in- 
strument of national policy. On the other hand, it 
constitutes belated recognition on the part of the 
Department that its own machinery must be over- 
hauled to meet the demands imposed by the war. 

ORGANIZING ECONOMIC DEFEL (SE. The re- 
organization of the State Department carries for- 
ward the broad program outlined three months ago 
when Vice President Wallace was assigned the task 
of coordinating policies and actions of the different 
government agencies working on economic defense. 
As Chairman of the Economic Defense Board, set 
up by Executive Order on July 31,* Mr. Wallace 
was charged with developing “integrated defense 
plans” and assuring that such plans were carried 
out. In line with this assignment, the Economic 
Defense Board has already t.ken over the functions 
of the Export Control Oi"ce formerly headed by 
Brigadier General Maxwei., and absorbed the Con- 
trols Division of the State Yepartment, which is now 
placed under the supervision of Milo Perkins, Ex- 
ecutive Director of the Wallace board. 

The efficiency of the State Department should be 
materially improved by the new organization, which 
was announced by Secretary Hull on October 10. 
Henceforth all of the Department’s economic func- 
tions will be directed through the Board of Economic 
Operations, headed by Dean Acheson, Assistant 
Secretary of State. Other members of the 10-man 
Board include Adolf Berle, Assistant Secretary of 
State; Herbert Feis, Economic Adviser; Leo Pas- 
volsky, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State; 
and the Chiefs of six divisions charged with specific 
economic tasks. These tasks are allocated as follows: 
Division of Commercial Policy and Agreements, 
charged with negotiation of commercial agreements; 
Division of Exports and Defense Aid, responsible 
for all matters of foreign policy involved in admin- 
istration of export control laws; Division of Defense 
Materials, responsible for matters of policy involved 
in procurement of strategic and critical materials; 
Division of Studies and Statistics, charged with prep- 
aration of statistical data for the Board of Economic 


*See Washington News Letter, Foreign Policy Bulletin, August 8, 1941. 


Operation; Division of World Trade Intelligence, | 
responsible for commercial information; Forej 
Funds and Financial Division, responsible for ques. 
tions of policy arising under U.S. control of foreign 
funds. Through the Board of Economic Operations, | 
each division will maintain close liaison with other | 
Government agencies engaged in economic work. 
Despite this drastic overhauling of State Depart. | 
ment machinery, it would be a mistake to assume! 
that the Department is adequately equipped to carry ) 
its share of the load imposed by the defense pro- 
gram. At best, the new organization merely creates 
the framework for a program of expansion which is , 
long overdue. The State Department is still operat. | 
ing on a budget of about $22,000,000 which is not 
much larger than the depression budget of 1932, | 
and about the same as that of 1940. It has allowed 
other government agencies to take the initiative in 
formulating economic policies, and has shown little| 
enterprise in recruiting new personnel. As a result,| 
important functions involving our foreign relations} 
have been taken over by other departments. 
EXPANDING DEFENSE NEEDS. With the! 
rapid expansion of defense production, the task con-| 
fronting all of the economic planning agencies has 
become increasingly more difficult. Defense expendi- 
tures are now running at the rate of about 18 bil- 
lion dollars annually, and by the end of this fiscal 
year the outlay is expected to reach an annual rate 
of 24 billion dollars, or approximately one-third of 
our national income. Last week, however, defense | 
officials were reported to be preparing an enormous| 
new program doubling existing production rates and | 
contemplating an outlay of more than 100 billion | 
dollars by the end of 1943 or 1944. 
While these reports have not been officially con- | 
firmed, they emphasize the need for effective co 
ordination and planning, particularly in the alloca- 
tion of raw materials. For example, according to 


current estimates, armament needs in 1942 will call . 
for about 1,500,000 tons of copper out of an esti: 


mated supply of 1,800,000 tons. Defense requife- 
ments for steel in 1942 are now placed at 35 million 
tons, as compared with a total estimated supply of 
89 million tons. The primary function of the State 
Department is not to pass on the technicalities of 
such defense requirements, but to formulate the 
strategic plans on which all production schedules | 
should be based. It can only perform the task w rth | 
completely adequate personnel and equipment. |

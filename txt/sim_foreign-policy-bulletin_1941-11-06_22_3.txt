NEED FOR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. 
What would be disastrous for the United States, and 
the other United Nations, would be to allow per- 
sonal or national ambitions and conflicts to divert 
our attention from the task of winning the war in 
the shortest possible time. Friction is bound to arise 
among any group of human beings working for a 
common end. It exists among the Nazis just as much 
as among the United Nations, and becomes all the 
more dangerous in totalitarian countries for being 
forced to seethe undercover instead of exploding into 
public criticism, as it does in the democratic coun- 
tries. But sacrifice of common ends—especially when 
this is a question of national survival—to private 
ambitions or quarrels is tantamount to criminal ir- 
responsibility. Such irresponsibility, wherever it 
appears, is peculiarly dangerous at this moment,

when Germany—although not Japan—may be nearg

earlier this year; and when nothing would be y 
helpful to Hitler as widening of the rifts both withiy 
and between the United Nations. Only constag 
vigilance on our part against any attempt to soy 
dissension among us can guard us against defey 
from within, such as France suffered before it eyg| 
came to grips with Germany. But such vigilang 
should not exclude—on the contrary, it should ig! 
clude—honest and straightforward public discussion 
of problems that threaten the unity of the Unite 
Nations, such as India, provided these discussion} 
take as their common ground the common desire b| 
win the war, and the peace after the war.

U.S. WINS FIRST ROUND IN SOLOMONS—AT HEAVY COST 


The Navy report of November 1 on the great 
fleet air battle of October 26 between Japanese and 
American forces east of the southern Solomons con- 
tains welcome news: two enemy battleships, two 
aircraft carriers, and three cruisers were hit, while 
100 planes, and probably 50 more, were destroyed. 
Since some of these vessels were struck time after 
time, it is quite possible that sinkings occurred later, 
when the battle was over. At any rate, the Japanese 
fleet soon withdrew, and the counteroffensive in the 
Solomons, which had seemed a bid for a speedy de- 
cision, reached the end of its first round. Not only 
do American troops retain all the ground they have 
held on Guadalcanal with its precious airfield, but 
on October 30 our surface ships bombarded enemy 
positions there for over two hours. Optimism con- 
cerning the final outcome is still not warranted (for 
example, the damage, as contrasted with sinkings, 
suffered by our vessels on October 26 has not yet 
been announced), but the enemy withdrawal of ships 
suggests a consideration too often overlooked—that 
the Japanese are having troubles of their own and do 
not find the path of reconquest an easy one.

and one heavy cruiser, while hits have been scored} 
on other vessels of these categories, as well as ait. 
craft carriers and battleships. An important part of | 
this destruction has resulted from very effective 

bombing of the main Japanese bases in the south 

west Pacific by aircraft under the command of Gen, 
eral MacArthur. On the night of October 28, for] 
example, two and perhaps more enemy vessels, in- 

cluding a warship, were hit in an attack on Rabaul} 
in New Britain, northwest of the Solomons. Two} 
nights later three raids on Buin in the northem| 
Solomons produced two hits on a heavy cruiser or 
battleship, probable extensive damage to a light| 
cruiser and aircraft carrier, the firing of an unidenti-| 

fied vessel, and two possible hits on a destroyer. | 

Before dawn on November 1, in another attack on 

Buin, a heavy cruiser was blown up and a light 
cruiser severely damaged, while a merchant vessel 

received a direct hit. That night our planes struck . 
once more in an exceptionally heavy drive. 


These were among the fruits of an air campaiga 
that began early in October, presumably as part of | 
a new Offensive strategy adopted in conjunction with 
the appointment of Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, 
Jr., as commander of the Solomons operations. Dur- 
ing the entire month Buin was raided thirteen times, 
Rabaul eleven times, and Buka in the northern Solo- 
mons nine times. Twenty-nine enemy ships were sunk 
or damaged and sixteen more possibly damaged, 
while thirteen aircraft were destroyed and seven 
others hit. The total announced United Nations’ loss 
was five planes. 


OUR SETBACKS AT SEA. There is no doubt, } 
however, that the United States Navy has suffered | 
serious losses, especially in the sinking of two ait- | 
craft carriers—the Wasp on September 15 in the | 
Solomons and a second, the name of which has not | |

yet been announced, on October 26 in the vicinity of 
the Santa Cruz Islands, to the southeast. Since the 
Lexington was lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea 
last May and the Yorktown in the Battle of Midway 
early in June, this—as far as information is available 
—leaves the Navy with only three regular carriers. 
On the other hand, additional carriers are being con- 
structed, or converted from tankers and merchant 
ships. Japan, which has lost most heavily in this 
category, is thought to have two or three regular 
carriers and three to six converted ones (i.e., a total 
of from five to nine), but the value of the latter 
vessels is limited. 


Since the Japanese are able to concentrate in the 
Pacific, while we are obliged by the necessities of 
global war to use many of our vessels elsewhere, one 
factor of significance is the probable numerical su- 
periority of the enemy fleet in almost all types of 
ships. This disparity in the Solomons area is sug- 
gested not only by public information about the two 
fleets, but also by some of our recent naval com- 
muniqués, which report an engagement between 
three United States minesweepers and an equal 
number of enemy destroyers, or the success of an 
American motor torpedo boat in hitting a Japanese 
destroyer. These unequal actions presumably indi-

cate the absence of larger American vessels on the 
spot—at least at the time. On the other hand, it is 
clear that throughout the Battle of the Solomons we 
have maintained air superiority, with significant re- - 
sults. Unfortunately, an advantage in the air is not 
enough, since naval craft still play an important role, 
especially in the landing of men and equipment. Vic- 
tory in the Pacific—apart from other factors—must 
wait until we have established both naval and air 
superiority, but our planes can serve to hold off the 
Japanese until our ships have been greatly augmented. 
WIDENING OF THE CONFLICT. Although 
the withdrawal of the Japanese fleet is generally re- 
garded as only temporary, it does not follow that 
the enemy plans first of all to return to the Guadal- 
canal area. A blow somewhere else—perhaps after a 
new period of recuperation and preparation—is at 
least equally possible, particularly since the conflict 
has broadened out into a struggle for the whole 
southwest Pacific area. Attention should therefore be 
given to the possibility that, having been unable to 
retake the southern Solomons by direct attack, Japan’s 
next move may be against the sea lanes essential to 


the maintenance of all our positions in the southwest 
Pacific.

CABINET CHANGES LEAVE CHILEAN POLICY OBSCURE 


The recent reshuffling of the Chilean Cabinet has 
done little to clarify a thoroughly embroiled situa- 
tion, and Santiago remains a question-mark on the 
inter-American horizon. On October 20 the Cabinet 
Ministers resigned en masse; this followed directly 
on the postponement of President Juan Antonio 
Rios’ visit to the United States—a step which, in 
turn, was motivated by the now famous Boston 
speech of Sumner Welles (October 8), charging 
Argentina and Chile with tolerating Axis espionage. 


On October 22 new Cabinet appointments were 
announced by a much harassed Chilean President. 
Rios’ first choice for Foreign Minister was discarded 
when German Riesco showed reluctance to accept be- 
fore taking elaborate soundings. The President's eye 
then fell on Joaquin Fernandez y Fernandez, Chile’s 
Ambassador to Uruguay, who was summoned home 
from Montevideo and recited the oath of office on Oc- 
tober 26. On his way through Buenos Aires, Fernandez 
was firmly taken in hand by Argentine Foreign Min- 
ister Enrique Ruiz Guifiazi, who shepherded him 
through a round of ceremonies, and presumably 
urged maintenance of a joint Chilean-Argentine 
neutrality front. Observers of the South American 
scene—recalling reports that Fernandez, as a dele- 
gate to the Inter-American Political Defense Com- 
mittee in Montevideo, had shown little enthusiasm 
for a strong hemispheric anti-Axis stand—kept their 


fingers crossed. Time alone will tell whether the new 
incumbent will represent any improvement at the 
Foreign Office over his predecessor, Ernesto Barros 
Jarpa, who had opposed a break with the Axis 
powers. 

Of the other Cabinet appointments, the most sig- 
nificant perhaps was the retention of youthful In- 
terior Minister Rail Morales Beltrami, Rios’ cam- 
paign manager during the last election. Morales has 
acted aggressively to curb Axis operations in Chile, 
pushing proceedings against three German agents 
whose detection and arrest recently called attention 
to the existence of a Nazi spy ring operating be- 
tween Chile and the Caribbean. When the three 
agents were released by a magistrate on a technical- 
ity, Morales promptly had them re-arrested by the 
use of decree power. They are to be confined on 
Quiriquina Island in the Bay of Concepcién, along 
with Hans Borchers, ex-German Consul General in 
New York City, who entered Chile illegally some 
months ago. On October 30 Morales told Ultimas 
Noticias that he was preparing special legislation for 
the suppression of Nazi activities in Chile, and that 
this would be submitted to an extraordinary session 
of Congress convening November 15. 


PUBLIC DISTURBED BY WELLES’ SPEECH. 
Public opinion in Chile seems to have been confused 
by the recent cycle of events. Two emotions have 


struggled for supremacy: first, the natural resent- 
ment of a sensitive people at what could only be 
interpreted as a rebuke from abroad; second, an ad- 
mission—often grudging—that Welles’ contention 
on the subject of espionage was perhaps well-founded 
and that Chile could not go on indefinitely running 
with the hare and hunting with the hounds. One of 
the most outspoken critics of the United States’ atti- 
tude was ex-President Arturo Alessandri, whose 
tirade against U.S. interference was broadcast as far 
afield as the pages of Bogotd’s E/ Tiempo. (the 
Colombian paper disclaiming any editorial identity 
with Alessandri’s point of view). During the last 
half of October democratic and “‘nationalist’”” demon- 
strators traded blows in the streets of Santiago, while 
the United States Embassy in that capital was recur- 
rently picketed by indignant youths demanding an 
apology for the Welles “affront.” On October 29 
the demonstrations were brought to a close by a 
torchlight procession of students which ended in 
front of the Moneda Palace. Addressing the partici- 
pants, President Rios thanked them for their patri- 
otism, but was careful to stress his sympathy for 
the democratic cause. 


INCIDENT EVOKES WIDE INTEREST IN 
LATIN AMERICA. Throughout the rest of Latin 
America, the dramatic postponement of the Rios 
visit stirred unusual interest. Such Nazi sheets as 
El Pampero of Buenos Aires gleefully exploited the 
incident as one more proof of Yankee meddling; 
on the other hand, E/ Mundo of Buenos Aires bravely 
spoke out in Washington’s defense, arguing that 
the United States was perfectly entitled to safeguard 
its interests as it pleased. Most Latin American papers 
skirted the issue tactfully. Meanwhile, from Mexico 
City, Rio de Janeiro, and Havana came reports of 
attempts to mediate between Washington and Santi- 
ago. In Caracas, where Venezuelan President Isaias 
Medina was acting as host to his recently installed 
Colombian colleague, dynamic Alfonso Lépez, the 
rumor got about that the two Presidents had their 
heads together over the possibilities of effecting a 
reconciliation between Chile and the United States. 
Obviously, the issue was one of general concern 
throughout the Americas. 


Whether or not the misunderstanding is cleared up, 
and the Rios visit materializes on a later occasion, the 
trip seems unlikely in the immediate future. Wash- 
ington is now concerned with plans for receiving 
Ecuadorean President Carlos Arroyo del Rio, who 
has received permission from his Congress to leave

the country, and is expected to arrive in the United 
States in mid-November. During the past year Ecua- 
dor has played the inter-American game loyally, 
swallowing an unpalatable frontier settlement in its 
dispute with Peru, and placing strategic areas on its 
coast and in the Galapagos Islands at the disposal 
of U.S. forces (a step not officially announced until 


six weeks ago). JouN I. B. McCuLLocu

STRATEGY AND DIPLOMACY 
IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 
by David H. Popper 
Britain and Italy are the chief antagonists in the Mediter- 
ranean. This report considers the general strategic situation 


confronting Italy, Britain and France, and the way in which 
that situation has been modified by recent developments.

DEMOCRACIES TAKE OFFENSIVE AT NYON 


HE anti-submarine agreement concluded at 

Nyon on September 11 by nine countries with 
Mediterranean and Black Sea interests may have 
the effect of giving Fascist dictatorships a taste 
of their own medicine. On September 9, in iden- 
tical notes rejecting the Franco-British invita- 
tion, Italy and Germany had refused to sit at the 
same table with the Soviet Union, suggesting, 
instead, that the piracy issue be submitted to the 
London Non-Intervention Committee — noted 
chiefly for its ability to overlook intervention— 
on which, ironically enough, the U.S.S.R. is also 
represented. Undeterred by this Fascist rebuff, 
Britain and France proceeded with the conference, 
which set a record for rapid action. 

The Nyon agreement provides for the formation 
of an anti-submarine patrol of warships and air- 
planes, most of which are to be furnished by 
Britain and France. Non-Spanish merchant ships, 
when traveling in the Mediterranean, will be di- 
rected to follow certain routes corresponding in 


general to the usual shipping lanes. The patrol 
shins will have instructions to count.+-attack and, 
if possible, destroy submarines which, in defiance 
of the 1930 London rules on submarine warfare, 
attack merchant ships not belonging to the In- 
surgent or Loyalist governments. The signatory 
states undertake to keep their own submarines in 
home ports or have them travel on the surface es- 
corted by surface craft. In the Western Mediter- 
ranean and on the high seas—with the exception 
of the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic, which Italy has 
been invited to patrol —the agreement is to be 


| carried out by Britain and France. In the Eastern 


Mediterranean the riparian powers, Yugoslavia, 
Greece, Turkey and Egypt, are to exercise control 
of their territorial waters and to lend the Franco- 
British patrol any assistance which may be re- 
quired. The Soviet Union, which had threatened 
to convoy its merchant ships, is thus barred from 
patrolling the Mediterranean and restricted to 


patrol duty in the Black Sea, along with Bulgaria, 
Rumania and Turkey. The signatories —at M. 
Litvinov’s suggestion — specifically declare that 
they do not mean to concede belligerent rights to 
either of the parties engaged in the Spanish 
conflict. 

The Nyon agreement represents an important 
step in the direction of collective action against 
an aggressor who, in this case, remains officially 
unidentified. It offers a favorable contrast to the 
situation created during the Ethiopian crisis, 
when Britain, having taken the lead in urging 
collective action against Italy, mobilized its fleet 
in the Mediterranean without first consulting the 
League powers, and only then sought the coopera- 
tion of France and other Mediterranean coun- 
tries. Many observers believe that the mere 
threat of force contained in the Nyon agreement 
will discourage further submarine attacks, which 
ceased abruptly once the conference had been 
summoned. 

The Mediterranean crisis sheds a revealing 
light or the Eurcpoan struggle for a balance of 
power, which finds in Spain an accidental battle- 
field. Britain—whose conservative government 
would not object to a victory of the Franco forces, 
provided it did not strengthen Italy’s strategic po- 
sition and give Germany a foothold in the Mediter- 
ranean—looks to an eventual settlement with both 
Italy and Germany, and has no desire to be used as 
a Soviet catspaw. France, under M. Chautemps’ 
leadership, has noticeably stiffened its stand 
against Fascist intervention in Spain. But the 
Chautemps government, like that of M. Blum, is 
faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, it be- 
lieves that the Soviet Union has been weakened 
by recent executions, and has no intention of im- 
plementing the Franco-Soviet pact with a military 
accord which might cause umbrage to Britain. 
On the other hand France fears that the U.S.S.R., 
if threatened with exclusion from Western Eu- 


SEP 90 1937 


rope, might seek security in a rapprochement with 
Germany. 

The Soviet Union, aware of these vacillations 
and fearing that Britain might persuade France 
to join its efforts for reconciliation with Germany 
and Italy, found in the Mediterranean crisis a 
heaven-sent opportunity to block an Anglo-Italian 
settlement, which might be the prelude for the 
Western four-power bloc long favored by Musso- 
lini. Italy played into the hands of the Soviet 
Union by absenting itself from the Nyon confer- 
ence. Yet eager as Mussolini is for Italian victory 
in Spain, it seems doubtful that, in the long run, 
he would sacrifice the hope of obtaining British 
cooperation—and with it financial assistance for 
the development of Ethiopia—or give Britain a 
pretext to align itself with the Soviet Union. 
Similarly, Hitler’s hatred of bolshevism, which 
he denounced once more at Nuremberg, does not 
blind him to the dangers of exclusive reliance on 
the Rome-Berlin axis. Friendship with Britain 
remains the cornerstone of Hitler’s foreign policy, 
as expressed in Mein Kampf and recently reiter- 
ated in a letter to Lord Rothermere. This con- 
flict of interests and policies, no less acute in the 
dictatorships than in the democracies, offers a 
hope that mutual vituperation may stop short of 
war, provided the democracies keep their heads 
and refuse to lend themselves to the designs of 
either fascism or communism.

FOUR YEAR PLAN OPPRESSES GERMANY 

The annual Nazi party gathering at Nuremberg, 
always more a spectacle than a congress, closed 
on September 13 with an impressive display of 
the Reich’s armed forces. Its sessions, lasting a 
week, were devoted as usual to rekindling the 
enthusiasm of the German people for National 
Socialism. In contrast to previous years, no new 
laws were proclaimed, nor any new campaigns 
inaugurated. It was a Congress of Labor, and 
domestic rather than international questions ab- 
sorbed the most attention. Hitler and his col- 
leagues admitted that difficult times were still 
ahead and stressed the necessity of hard work, 
discipiine and self-sacrifice. 

Of most immediate concern to the Nazi govern- 
ment is the economic situation. Production, it 
is true, is still rising, and the output of consumers’ 
goods is now sharing more fully in this increase 
than before. Under the stimulus of world eco- 
nomic recovery, exports have markedly expanded 
and are bringing better prices on the world mar- 
ket. The Four Year Plan for the development 
of domestic raw materials has been more success- 
ful than was anticipated abroad. For example, 
the output of synthetic “cell wool” will probably

amount to 20 per cent of the consumption of raw 
cotton this year and, with a third successive re. 
duction in prices effective September 1, the cost of 
this material is now more closely approaching that 
of imported cotton. Superficially, government 
finances also appear in order. In August another 
so-called consolidation loan of 700 million marks 
was floated, and with such success that the amount 
was raised 150 million. The total of such loans 
issued since 1935 now aggregates 6,850,000,000 
marks. 

On the other hand, certain very disquieting 
factors have appeared. While the foreign trade 
balance for this year is on the whole more favor- 
able, the trend during the last three months has 
been in the opposite direction. Another mediocre 
grain harvest will necessitate much greater im- 
ports of foodstuffs. By decree of July 27 the Reich 
requisitioned all rye and wheat for use only a 
bread grain, but even this measure wil! leave 
much feed to be imported. The extraordinary 
rise in the production of iron, steel, machines and 
similar goods has made for a continued shortage 
of essential raw materials. The construction of 
plants to carry out the Four Year plan is necessi- 
tating the importation of more raw materials 
than these plants can at present contribute to the 
German economy. To relieve the shortage of iron, 
Goring on July 23 set up a state corporation for 
the mining and smelting of all unexploited do- 
mestic deposits of iron ore, which are known to 
have a very low ore content. This step has ac- 
centuated the opposition of certain industrialists 
to growing state interference with private initia- 
tive. These critics have rallied behind Dr. 
Schacht, the Minister for Economics, who is 
known to be at odds with the more radical Nazis. 

Dr. Schacht is reported particularly alarmed 
over the condition of the government’s finances. 
Despite the numerous “consolidation” loans issued 
in recent years, the Reich’s concealed floating debt 
is still rising, as evidenced by the bil! holdi of 
the Reichsbank and other German banks ¥ 
phenomenal increase in the public debt | 
made possible by the government’: ictical 
monopoly of the capital market. With : in- 
dustries demanding capital and old industries pro- 
ducing at capacity and requiring renewal and 
extension of plant, private capital issues are now 
becoming daily more urgent. In Dr. Schacht’s 
opinion, this situation calls imperatively for strict 
government economy, slowing-up of the costly 
Four Year plan, and concentration on export 
trade. Neither Hitler nor Géring, however, ap- 
pear willing to alter the Nazi program, and the res- 
ignation of Schacht is once more strongly rumored.

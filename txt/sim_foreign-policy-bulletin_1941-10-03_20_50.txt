ANTI-NAZI REVOLT SPREADS IN EASTERN EUROPE 


GUERRILLA WAR IN YUGOSLAVIA. Mean- 
while, Dr. Ante Pavelitch, the Italian-imposed leader 
of Croatia, has had such difficulty in keeping order 
within his domains that Italy has found it necessary 
to reoccupy the Dalmatian coastal zone between the 
Adriatic Sea and the Dinaric Alps. The Ustachis, 
who are the mainstay of the Pavelitch régime, have 
clashed frequently with Serbian guerrillas, and a 
number of them are said to have deserted to the 
enemy. On September 23 it was reported from Rome 
that fifty “Communists and Jews” had been executed 
as “the intellectual instigators’ of bomb explosions 
in the telephone exchange at the Croatian capital. 

In the Serbian remnant of Yugoslavia Premier 
Milan Neditch, who was installed as ruler in Bel- 
grade by the Germans, has disclosed the existence of 
a state of “civil war.” His troops have been engaged 
in a series of “battles” with guerrilla bands who sally 
forth from inaccessible mountain strongholds to blow 
up bridges and railway tracks or ambush small de- 
tachments of Germans. Whole villages have fallen 
into the hands of the guerrillas. Unable to cope with 
this growing resistance, General Neditch had had 
to call in additional German reinforcements. On Sep- 
tember 27 Budapest reported that German dive- 
bombers, operating in conjunction with General 
Neditch’s troops, had virtually destroyed the town of 
Uzice on the Belgrade-Sarajevo railway. 

The exiled governments, all of which are repre- 
sented in London, have done much to fan the spirit 
of anti-Nazi revolt in occupied Europe. Their success 
has encouraged the formation of other national coun- 
cils. At the end of September a simultaneous move- 
ment was launched in Britain and the United States 
to free Hungary from Nazi domination. In London a 
committee has been formed under the leadership of 
former Premier Michael Karolyi, and in the United 
States a similar organization has been set up by Tibor 
Eckhardt, exiled head of the Small Farmers party. 

















On September 27 it was also announced that a Free 
Austrian National Council, with headquarters at 
Toronto, had been established under the chairman- 
ship of Dr. Hans Rott, a former member of the 
Schuschnigg government. In London, meanwhile, 
General Charles de Gaulle formally organized a pro- 
visional government on September 25 by appointing 
a Frce French National Council. 

INTER-ALLIED CONFERENCE. While the 
primary task of these governments or committees is to 
crystallize opposition to Nazism in conquered Europe 
and to assist Britain in winning the war, they can also 
perform important work in laying the foundation for 
a new and better Europe in the event of victory. The 
latter task was emphasized at the meeting in London 
on September 24 of the Inter-Allied Conference, 
which was attended by representatives of Britain, the 
Dominions, the Soviet Union and the free govern- 
ments of nine occupied European countries. The Con- 
ference unanimously endorsed the 8-points of the At- 
lantic Charter drawn up by President Roosevelt and 
Prime Minister Churchill as the guiding principles of 
a peace settlement. The Conference demonstrated, 
however, that much work remains to be done before 
all the governments see eye to eye on the practical ap- 
plication of these principles. It indicated, too, that the 
leadership of Britain and the United States would not 


ARGENTINE AIR PLOT STIRS 


The occupation of all military air bases in Argen- 
tina by Argentine troops on September 23, in a series 
of spectacular moves which have not yet been fully 
explained, quickly became an issue in the long poli- 
tical controversy between the government of Acting 
President Ramén Castillo and the Radical party, 
which controls a majority of votes in the Chamber 
of Deputies. 

A subversive plot was apparently forestalled when 
government forces took over important military air- 
dromes in Cérdoba and Parana, and later extended 
their precautions to other parts of the country. On 
September 25 General Angel Maria Zuloaga was re- 
moved from his post as head of the military air arm, 
and at least two other key officers were arrested. As 
further army air corps men were summoned for ques- 
tioning about the plot, which was centered in three

Vice President Castillo is a member. It has been ex- 
in Argentina that the Senate inquiry may yet 

come out into the open, and that in deference to 
pular sentiment Senor Castillo may publicly outline 





4 new pro-democratic policy before the December 
elections in Buenos Aires province, which have usual- 
ly determined elections for the Presidency. 


ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH DEMOC- 
RACIES. The Argentine government has already 
taken several important economic steps toward lining 
up with the democratic powers, partly in response to 
popular opinion and partly in an effort to adjust its 
eonomy to current needs. Late in August it took over, 
by purchase, 16 Italian merchant ships, totaling over 
98,000 tons, which had been laid up in Argentine 

rts. Since these vessels will be used primarily for 
trading with the United States, their operation will 
release additional American tonnage for carrying sup- 
plies to Britain. Early last month, moreover, Argen- 
tina accepted an Anglo-American trade deal which 
provided for the disposal of farm surpluses to the 
Allies and barred future sales of strategic war ma- 
terials to the Axis. The government has now prom- 
ised the Americas the exclusive use of Argentine tung- 
sten, beryl, aluminum, mica, manganese, iron and 
copper, in line with measures previously taken by 
| most of the other Latin American countries.

Berlin Diary, by William L. Shirer. New York, Knopf, 
1941. $2.09 


A very readable and yet thoughtful account of Europe’s 
march toward war and the first year of the conflict, as seen 
by an American correspondent in the German capital. 
Without pretending to give the “inside story,” Mr. Shirer 
presents many significant observations on the Germany 
that lies behind the censorship. His comments on German 
morale and on the collapse of France are especially inter- 
esting. He believes that after subduing Europe and Africa, 
Hitler contemplates war against the United States. 


Modern Democracy, by Carl L. Becker. New Haven, Yale 
University Press, 1941. $2.00 


A brief, but profound and stimulating, appraisal of 
“democracy as it was ideally projected and democracy as 
it actually functions today.” 


I Was a Nazi Flier, by Gottfried Leske. New York, Dial 
Press, 1941. $2.50 
This purports to be the diary of a Luftwaffe pilot partici- 
pating in the Battle of France and the bombing of London 
and later was shot down over England. Its author is re- 
vealed as almost completely subservient to Nazi propa- 
ganda—the ideal product of the Hitler régime. 


Who’s Who in Latin America, by Percy Alvin Martin. 
Stanford University, Stanford University Press, second 
edition, 1940. $5.50 


A biographical dictionary, indispensable for the serious 
student of Latin American affairs.

terest to all concerned with problems of American defense.

Washington News Letter 














WASHINGTON BUREAU 
National Press Bullding 


SEPT. 29.—The Administration drive to modify 
or repeal the Neutrality Act gained momentum this 
week following the introduction of a resolution call- 
ing for outright repeal and formulation of plans to 
lift the ban on arming of American merchant ships. 
While Congressional leaders indicate that they will 
not press for action until the second lease-lend appro- 
priation has been disposed of, the lines are forming 
for another struggle over foreign policy. 


WHAT IS LEFT OF NEUTRALITY? In discus- 
sing the basic issue, certain questions of fact have 
been raised with respect to the present status of the 
Neutrality Act of 1939. Just how much of the orig- 
inal law has been repealed or nullified, and what 
provisions are still in effect ? Where and how do these 
continuing provisions conflict with the foreign policy 
to which the United States is now committed? In 
what ways is the Executive hampered in fulfilling the 
commitment to give all-out aid to the countries re- 
sisting the Axis? Can existing restrictions be further 
modified by Executive action, or is new Congressional 
legislation imperative ? 

Before considering the status of the Neutrality Act 
of 1939, it should be noted that most of our earlier 
statutes defining the duties of a neutral under the 
rules of international law have already been super- 
seded by new legislation or nullified by Executive de- 
cree. These earlier statutes were invoked by the Pres- 
ident in his first neutrality proclamation of Septem- 
ber 5, 1939, which set forth some 28 specific regula- 
tions to be observed within the jurisdiction of the 
United States in conformity with domestic law and 
customary usage. Among the rules then invoked were 
the customary prohibitions against enlistment in the 
armed forces of warring nations, fitting out or arming 
belligerent vessels or furnishing supplies to belliger- 
ent warships. Most of these traditional limitations 
were swept away with the passage of the Lend-Lease 
Act, which automatically canceled any existing legis- 
lation contrary to its provisions. Subsequent Executive 
orders or Presidential proclamations have annulled at 
least 25 of the 28 regulations, thus eliminating almost 
the last vestige of neutrality under the law of nations. 

Despite the abandonment of traditional neutrality, 
the Act of 1939 remains on the statute books and, 
with certain exceptions, its legal restrictions are still 
in force. Since the repeal of the arms embargo in 
October 1939, Congress has not directly amended any 
portion of the existing law, although in effect it 





nullified the prohibition on loans and credits (Sec. 7 
by permitting the transfer of defense materials an4 
services under the Lend-Lease Act. Other provisions 
—such as the restrictions covering travel on Amer. 
ican vessels (Sec. 5) and the use of American pork 
by belligerent ships (Secs. 10-11)—have been t¢ } 
laxed by Executive rules and regulations. Apart from } 
these modifications, however, the law remains yp. 

changed. 

Of the provisions still in force, three are in o 
conflict with the purposes ot the lend-lease program | 
and the declared policy of the President. These are: | 
Sec. 2 (a) forbidding “any American vessel to cary 
any passengers or any articles or materials’ to any | 
belligerent state named by the President; Sec. 3 te. 
quiring the President to define “combat areas’ 
through which no American vessel may pass; Sec. 6 
forbidding the arming of American merchant vessels, 

With respect to transportation of war supplies~ / 
other than arms and ammunition—the President has | 
some discretion in defining combat areas and finding | 
the existence of a “state of war.” Thus by removing | 
the “combat area” in the Red Sea, and by failing to } 
find a ‘‘state of war’’ between Germany and the Soviet | 
Union, President Roosevelt has enabled American { 
ships to carry supplies to Suez and Vladivostok. | 
At the request of the State Department, the Attorney | 
General gave an opinion on September 15 holding | 
that the term “United Kingdom” as used in the Nev- | 
trality Act applies only to England, Scotland, Wales | 
and Northern Ireland, thus permitting American ves | 
sels to enter any of Britain’s possessions not express ) 
ly named in proclamations. 

Under the law as it stands, however, the President 
has no discretion to permit American vessels to entet | 
any port in the United Kingdom, or any port of any | 
European belligerent, or even the Atlantic ports of | 
Canada. While the law allows American ships t0 
proceed through the “inland waters” of the Bay of | 
Fundy to St. John, it forbids them to enter Halifax. 
The net effect of these mandatory restrictions has 
been to force the transfer of more than 500 Americat 
vessels to foreign registry and in numerous othet 
ways to invite a policy of subterfuge. It must be ap | 
parent, however, that the basic contradictions between 
the Neutrality Act and the declared policy of the 
United States cannot be removed by measures withia 








} 


the technical discretion of the Executive. The com } 


flict can be resolved only if both Congress and the 


Executive are prepared to face the issue squarely.

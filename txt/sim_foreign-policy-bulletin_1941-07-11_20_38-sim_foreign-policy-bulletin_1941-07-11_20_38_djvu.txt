TOKYO WEIGHS COURSE IN GERMAN-SOVIET WAR 


AS the war in China enters its fifth year, Tokyo 
is confronted with a new series of problems 
ceated by the German-Soviet clash. The Nazi in- 
vasion Of the Soviet Union has automatically cut 
Japan's trade connections with Germany, from which 
it was receiving machinery and technical equipment 
no longer available in other markets. Japan’s al- 
ready overstrained economy must be readjusted to 
cope with this additional and obviously unexpected 
difficulty. 

Even more disturbing to Tokyo are the political 
and strategic implications of the Soviet-German war, 
especially if hostilities are protracted. Under such 
conditions, British and American ties with the So- 
viet Union, both military and economic, will tend to 
grow closer—a result which will necessarily be re- 
fected in the Far Eastern situation. In the past, So- 
viet munitions have been supplied to China in 


_ considerable amounts, and these supplies will con- 
| tinue to be sent, according to reports from Chung- 
‘king. In the new situation, Soviet bombers and 





wubmarines at Vladivostok atid the Soviet Far Eastern 
Army, as well as Anglo-American naval and air 
power, become potential elements of a Far Eastern 
front against Japan that already includes the Chinese 
armies. 

TOKYO SEEKS A POLICY. Prospects of this 
political realignment in the Far East have created 
a dificult problem for Japanese diplomacy, which 
has tended thus far to move with extreme caution. 
An extraordinary series of meetings was held at 
Tokyo in the ten-day period from June 22 to July 2. 
They included no less than five liaison conferences 
between Cabinet members and the High Command, 
separate conferences of army, navy and government 
oficials, and a number of personal reports to the 
Emperor by the highest officials. These preliminary 
meetings were climaxed on July 2 by an Imperial 
Conference—the fourth since the China war broke 


out in 1937, and the eighth in Japanese history. In 
the noncommittal announcement which followed, it 
was said that the Imperial Conference had reached 
decisions “‘on important national policies to meet the 
current situation.”” Dome, the Japanese news agency, 
stated that these decisions were expected “to be 
gradually translated into action.” The cautious word- 
ing of these statements would seem to indicate that 
Tokyo plans no immediate action of a decisive na- 
ture, but intends to guide its policy by the progress 
of events. Japan’s neutrality pact with the USSR, 
and the clear proof that Germany was the aggressor, 
enables it to hold its hand, for the time being at 
least, without thereby infringing its alliance with the 
Axis powers. 

The fact that the triple alliance is still being main- 
tained, however, was made apparent on July 1, when 
Germany and Italy extended formal diplomatic rec- 
ognition to Wang Ching-wei's puppet régime at 
Nanking. Similar action was taken by the Axis satel- 
lites in Europe, including Rumania, Hungary and 
Spain. Two different interpretations of this move are 
possible. If it was merely an Axis concession to hold 
Japan in line, it may indicate that the triple alliance 
has run into difficulties. On the other hand, it may 
involve a secret arrangement by which Japan, at 
some opportune moment, will render direct assistance 
to the Axis. In this case, additional Japanese pres- 
sure against the Anglo-American positions in south- 
east Asia might logically be expected. Germany has 
consistently sought to use Japan as a means of di- 
verting Anglo-American forces to the Pacific, al- 
though it might press Japan to move into Siberia if 
the Nazi drive into Soviet territory bogs down. 

Several reports suggest that Japan is preparing to 
extend its influence in Indo-China and Thailand, but 
no definite action along these lines has yet occurred. 
On July 3 the Japanese government requisitioned 
two of its vessels engaged in carrying chrome ore, 

















cocoanut oil, hemp and other Philippine products 
to the United States. One vessel, already at Kobe, 
was ordered to unload “at the risk and expense of 
the owners of the cargo,” while the second will prob- 
ably discharge its cargo at Manila. At his press con- 
ference on the same day, Acting Secretary of State 
Sumner Welles declared that Japan was within its 
rights in requisitioning the ships and that the United 
States had previously taken similar action with re- 
gard to American vessels. The current shortage of 
Japanese shipping is probably sufficient explanation 
of this action, although it may have constituted a 
reprisal for restrictions placed on the export of cer- 
tain Philippine products to Japan. Tokyo has also 
curtailed sailings on one of its shipping lines to New 
York, but no general recall order has been issued. 


REACTIONS IN WASHINGTON. In dealing 
with the new conditions in the Far East presented by 
the German-Soviet war, Washington has adopted 
the same attitude of restraint displayed by Japan. Re- 
ferring to the Imperial Conference, Acting Secretary 
of State Sumner Welles declared on July 3 that the 
United States “naturally hopes that Japan’s new for- 
eign policy will be of such a character as to make for 
maintenance of peace in the Pacific area.” An issue of 
some difficulty may develop over the shipment of 
American supplies to the Soviet Union by way of 
Vladivostok. The President’s decision on June 25 


BRITISH IMPROVE POSITIONS AS NAZIS DRIVE EAST 


Throwing the full weight of its armed forces 
against the Red Army, the German High Command 
has continued to exploit successfully the initial ad- 
vantage of its attack on the U.S.S.R. by pushing 
well beyond the pre-1939 boundaries of Russia from 
the Gulf of Finland to northern Rumania. Nazi 
strategists apparently hope to smash the Soviet po- 
litical structure by inflicting crushing defeats on the 
Red troops and by capturing Moscow, the nerve 
center of the Union. Thereby they would gain con- 
trol of the resources and industries of Russia before 
the defenders can effectively carry out the ‘scorched 
earth” policy enunciated by Premier Joseph Stalin in 
his radio address of July 3. 

Out of the welter of conflicting claims on the 


progress of the opposing armies, only a few reports 
appear well founded. The main German drive is not

evidently a trial balloon, designed to test Soviet and 
American reactions. 


Unless Japan should undertake further aggressive 
action, there would seem to be small likelihood of 
a drastic change in the Far Eastern situation durip 
the immediate future. Both the United States and 
the Soviet Union have every incentive to prevent the 
development of critical issues in their relations with 
Japan at this time. The U.S.S.R. will not be likely 
to afford Japan any pretext for disavowing th 
Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact. Tokyo, on the other 
hand, cannot be unaware that under present circum. 
stances closer Anglo-American-Soviet collaboration 
in the Far East—which it most fears—will probably 
be stimulated by aggressive moves on its part. It 
remains to be seen whether German pressure, or 
Japan's willing collaboration with the Axis, will lead 
Tokyo to take irrevocable steps.

method of winning over the French and native 
gldiers. Since the opening of hostilities on June 8, 
the Allies have advanced through the Syrian desert 
from Iraq and moved slowly up the coast from 
Palestine. General Henri Dentz, commanding the 
Vichy army, was reported on July 4 to have re- 
fysed an armistice, but unless aid reaches him via 
Turkey, whose leaders have refused to permit the 
transit of French troops or the sale of war matériel, 
he must soon capitulate. 


The surrender on July 4 of the remaining Italian 
detachments in the Galla Sidamo province of Ethi- 
opia leaves at large only a few thousand troops of 
the 250,000 who garrisoned Italian East Africa when 
the British began their offensive in December 1940. 
When the remaining centers of Italian resistance in 
the wild country north of Lake Tana in Ethiopia and 
southwest of Assab in Eritrea are reduced, the Allied 
troops in East Africa will move northward to rein- 
force the Army of the Nile. 


The steady flow of American matériel to Egypt, 
now estimated at almost a shipload daily, matched 
by the arrival of troop reinforcements from British 
Dominions and colonies east of Suez, ought to 
strengthen the Allied forces in North Africa. In the 
meantime, the Axis army in Libya has been weak- 
ened by the withdrawal of almost all German planes 
and by the sinking of supply ships in the Mediter- 
ranean by British naval and air action. Further 





British moves in the Middle East may be expected 


asa result of far-reaching organizational changes an- 
nounced on July 1. The replacement of General Sir 
Archibald Wavell by General Sir Claude Auchinleck 
as Commander in the Middle East, and the assign- 
ment of Captain Oliver Lyttleton, formerly President 
of the Board of Trade, to handle political questions 
in the Middle East as a direct representative of the 
British Cabinet, portends increased activity on the 
shores of the eastern Mediterranean. 


The transfer of Wavell from Cairo to Delhi has 
been interpreted in some London circles as indicative 
of the desire of the British government to entrust to 
one of its foremost generals the preparation of the 
defense of India. This explanation presumes the 
victory of Hitler over the Russians, followed by a 
drive across Turkestan or the mountain range stretch- 
ing from the Himalayas to the Caucasus. While the 
Nazis have demonstrated their ability to perform 
almost impossible feats, some time must elapse be- 
fore they can expect to appear on the borders of 


India.

A second group of observers regards Wavell’s 
shift as an expression by the British Cabinet of its 
dissatisfaction with the conduct of the campaigns in 
Greece, Crete and Libya, and possibly of disagree- 
ment between Churchill and Wavell over future 
movements in the Middle East. The division of 
Wavell’s powers between a new commanding officer 
and a representative of the London Cabinet may in- 
dicate the Prime Minister's intention to maintain 
closer control over the situation. 

If the British are to seize the initiative again in the 
Mediterranean theater, they must strike soon, pos- 
sibly clearing the Axis forces out of Libya or ob- 
taining strategic positions in Turkey from which to 


threaten Germany's flank. Louts E. FRECHTLING

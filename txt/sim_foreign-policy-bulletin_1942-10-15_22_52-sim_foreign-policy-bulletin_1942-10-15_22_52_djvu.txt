JOINT RESPONSIBILITY OF UNITED NATIONS KEY TO POST-WAR SECURITY 


D IVERSE as are the specific items that could be 
included in the agenda of the three-power 
conference in Moscow, they will all fall under the 
same general heading: the search for security against 
war once the present conflict is over. Today few in the 
United Nations would dispute the French thesis of 
the inter-war years—whose reiteration by French 
statesmen caused the British and Americans to ac- 
cuse France of unbridled militarism—that security 
must precede disarmament. Few believe that, with- 
out armaments, the United Nations could preserve 
the fruits of victory. But when all has been said 
and done, the question still remains of how to use 
the industrial and military power that will in- 
dubitably be at the command of Britain, Russia and 
the United States in such a way as to give assurance 
of safety not only to each of the three great powers 
alone, or to the three combined, but also to all the 
other nations whose efforts will make victory 


possible. 


CAN EXPANSION GIVE SECURITY ? One way 
—a tried and tested way—in which nations have 
sought to protect themselves against aggression in 
the past has been to establish control over the ad- 
joining territories of weaker neighbors, either by 
incorporating them outright within their own fron- 
tiers, or by claiming that they come within their 
sphere of influence. Russia’s occupation of the Bal- 
tic states in 1939 is an example of the first practice; 
joint Anglo-Russian occupation of Iran in 1941 is an 
example of the second. 

Quite aside from the question whether such prac- 
tices are compatible with the lip-service all United 
Nations governments have been paying to democracy 
and the rights of small nations and national minori- 


ties, it still remains to be proved that they can assure 


the security even of the great powers. The idea that 
mere extension of territory is in itself a form of 
protection against aggression dates back to the period 


ee ee 


when wars between nations were waged primarily 
on land, and it seemed advisable to place as much 
land space as possible between oneself and one’s 
potential opponent. But the development of the air- 
plane as a weapon is invalidating this concept, and 
will invalidate it even more in the future. Hitler 
achieved tremendous expansion of German territory 
—but his land “fortress” is exposed to bombing 
from the air. And so will the territories of any other 
great powers who seek security in expansion. Mere 
acquisition of land or spheres of influence is an- 
other version of the Maginot Line. It creates the il- 
lusion of security without coming to grips with the 
reasons why nations go to war. 


THREAT OF TERRITORIAL FREE-FOR-ALL. 
Should Britain and the United States, through a de- 
sire to placate Russia or to express their appreciation 
of the part the Russians are playing in the war, agree 
to the acquisition by the U.S.S.R. of territories along 
its borders, without any guarantee of the rights of 
individuals in these areas, that would be the signal 
for a free-for-all territorial scramble. Then Britain 
could, with equal justification, claim that protec- 
tion of its lifeline through the Mediterranean neces- 
sitates retention of the Italian colonies it has occu- 
pied in Africa, and even acquisition of bases in 
Sicily, Sardinia, and Greece. Then, too, there would 
be nothing to prevent the United States from in- 
sisting that we must control all the islands.in the 
Pacific, and possibly other areas in Asia, to guard 
this country against future aggression by Japan. The 
race for territorial spoils would be on—with only 
one predictable outcome: another, and even more 
deadly, war between the victors in the present conflict. 

NEED FOR JOINT RESPONSIBILITY. At the 
same time, it is clear that Britain and the United 
States cannot merely reject Russia’s demand for se- 
curity through control of adjoining territories. They 
must propose a workable alternative which they in- 


tend to support with all the power at their disposal. 

An alternative, which is gradually taking shape in 

the form of concrete measures of Allied coopera- 

tion, has been described as “joint responsibility” for 

Europe. This is another phrase for international col- 

laboration, with proper emphasis on the responsi- 

bility that rests on the great powers for making 
international machinery work, not only for their own 
benefit, but for the benefit of all. 
Such collaboration, to be effective, must rest on 
’ gecognition by the great powers that they will be 
unable, single-handed, to achieve their own protec- 
tion in the future, even if their peoples were willing 
to forego indefinitely any improvement in living 
standards and any advance in human welfare for the 
sake of maintaining after the war national military 
establishments commensurate with their wartime 
needs. The great powers must also face the fact that 
their own security will increase in direct ratio to the 
sense of security and stability they can give to the 
small nations, whose fears and discontents would 
otherwise be a constant source of concern to the 
great powers themselves, and a potential danger to 
world stability. But neither must the small nations 
again seek to play the role of “irresponsibles,” or 
seek illusory refuge in neutrality, or allow them- 
selves to become pawns of one or other of their more 
powerful neighbors. 

No one would claim that this alternative to an- 
other balance of power through spheres of influ- 
ence system can be easily or promptly worked out. 
Mutual suspicions and recriminations are bound to

The mass starvation now occurring throughout 
Bengal province, including its capital at Calcutta, 
will inevitably have repercussions on British-Indian 
relations as well as on India’s effectiveness in the 
war. Bengal, containing an important part of the 
country’s modern industry, as well as some 60 mil- 
lion people, stands next door to Burma and is un- 
doubtedly slated to play a significant role in the 
recovery of that territory from the Japanese. Con- 
sequently, more than humanitarian interest attaches 
to the British Broadcasting Company’s statement of 
September 18 that there is not a village in the prov- 
ince in which the inhabitants are receiving as many 
as two meals a day. With regard to Calcutta— 
India’s largest center, with a population of more than 
2,000,000—the Provincial Food Minister estimated 
a week later that 50 persons were dying of starva- 
tion every day. And on September 29 alone, 197 
persons in that city were reported dead from lack of 
food—an indication of the growing seriousness of 
the famine. Cholera was also said to have broken out 
in a number of places. 

WHAT ARE THE REASONS? Many factors are 
mentioned, in discussions of the food crisis: shortage

persist, and every step forward may be followed by 
backsliding. But the important thing is that, at the 
Moscow conference, the three great powers should 
make a clear choice between the alternatives, should 
set their course in one direction, instead of the! 
other. Then many of the doubts and anxieties tha 
hang like a pall over the battlefields could be dis. 
pelled, giving us all a clearer vision of the future, 
Then, too, the key problem of what to do about | 
Germany would assume new meaning. For we might | 
begin to see—as the Russians already appear to see 
—that to make Europe safe from renewed German 
aggression we should strive not so much to weaken 
Germany (this could not be done permanently) but 
to strengthen the continent, and the world, through 
post-war mutual political, economic and military aid / 
among the United Nations. Such aid, which in war. | 
time can bring the defeat of Germany, could i ' 
peacetime literally neutralize its resurgence, as well | 
as the expansionist intentions of any other potential 
aggressor. 


No one who knows or is capable of imagining the 
physical and moral havoc wrought in Europe by four, 
years of conflict, no one who has experienced of | 
witnessed the agony of war partings and war losses, 
can believe that any stone will be left unturned at the | 
Moscow conference in trying to prevent the recur 
rence of such havoc and such agony.

of transport facilities; hoarding of food grains; loss 
of India’s normal import of 1,500,000 tons of rice 
from Burma; unwillingness on the part of provinces 
with surplus grain to make supplies available for” 
Bengal and other deficit areas; the decline in Ben- 


gal’s rice crop last winter from 9,000,000 to | 


000,000 tons as a result of cyclones, floods and fears 
of Japanese invasion; the use of food from India to 
feed the armed forces at home and abroad, as well | 


as refugees from Burma; and maladministration of } 


the part of the Indian government. Clearly, there is 
no shortage of explanations, but it would appear that 
the main question now being asked, both in Britain 
and India, is why the Central administration, headed 
by the Viceroy, did not long ago adopt measutes 
adequate to meet a situation that was obviously ap | 
proaching. 

The chief defense offered by the government is 
that the Central authorities in New Delhi have been 
unable to act effectively because of the selfish oppo 
sition of certain Indian provincial officials and that, 
in any case, the Bengal administration is responsible 
for food distribution in its territory. But, according |

October 8, this explanation is not accepted by the 
British public which is “deeply shocked” at the 
famine reports. One may surmise that many English- 
men who have looked forward to friendly relations 
with post-war India, on the basis of independence 
or Dominion status, are afraid that what is happen- 
ing in Bengal will bring new bitterness into a sit- 
uation already filled with antagonism. The official 
analysis, moreover, is rejected on the ground that 
if, as the government maintains, India is not ripe 
for self-rule during the war, then Britain cannot 
disavow responsibility for running the country 
properly. 

JAPANESE PROPAGANDA IS BUSY. Not the 
least important aspect of the situation is the use to 
which it is being put by the Japanese short-wave 
radio. Subhas Chandra Bose, former nationalist 
leader who went over to the Axis several years ago, 
has been broadcasting an offer of 100,000 tons of 
tice to be delivered to India from Japanese-occupied 
territory as soon as Britain is ready to accept. This 
shrewd suggestion is said to be having some effect. 
Indian propagandists working for Tokyo are also 
predicting that the Japanese-organized “Indian In- 
dependence Army” will shortly go into the field on 
the India-Burma frontier. 

When a situation has become as bad as that in 
Bengal, there is no simple solution. The best that 
can be done for the starving is to bring in larger 
supplies of food from neighboring areas and for- 
eign countries as rapidly as possible. In a long-term 
sense, action is needed against hoarding landlords 
and profiteering merchants. Popular participation 
could be very helpful in this connection, for in a 
country where a decentralized village economy still 
bulks large, the local peasant will be better informed

than any outside administrator about those who are 
responsible for raising prices and withholding stocks 
from the market. Such popular support, however, can 
be mobilized only under nationalist leadership, i.e. 
as the result of a settlement between the government 
and the main Indian groups. This is one reason why 
new British-Indian discussions are necessary, if India 
is to furnish a sound war base and play its full part 
in the struggle with Japan.

Food and Farming in Post-War Europe, by P. Lamartine 
Yates and D. Warriner. New York, Oxford University

Excellent short survey of Europe’s farming conditions 
and outline of a program for rehabilitating the peasantry. 
Among the proposals are water power development on a 
regional basis, abolition of the strip system, creation of 
new industries, and long-term credits from abroad.

Prominent English socialist analyzes trends since World 
War I and concludes that “either political democracy must 
be the master of economic monopoly or economic monopoly 
will be the master of political democracy.” He insists that 
the drift of American experience has been in much the 
same direction as Europe’s, requiring the United States 
to establish a “planned democracy.”

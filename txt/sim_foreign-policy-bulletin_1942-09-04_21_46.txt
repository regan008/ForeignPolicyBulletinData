THREE YEARS OF NAZI CONQUEST FAIL TO QUELL EUROPE 


workers to other parts of the continent, by closing 
their factories, and by appropriating their financial 
and raw material resources for the benefit of the 
Nazi war machine. 

GROWING TIDE OF RESISTANCE. Yet at 
the very moment when Hitler is seeking to consolidate 
his conquests, it becomes increasingly evident that the 
one thing he cannot achieve today, while there is 
still hope he may be defeated, is the pacification of 
Europe. If the Nazis had been as clever as they be- 
lieved themselves to be, they would have sought, 
from the start, to win prostrate Europe with prom- 
ises of a better world for all—for the conquered 
peoples as well as for the victorious Germans. In- 
stead, in three years of war, they have given a fore- 
taste of the treatment they plan to inflict on Europe 
—and on other parts of the world—if they emerge 
as final victors. Most Americans, with no first-hand 
experience of Nazi terrorism, find it difficult to un- 
derstand what superhuman qualities of courage and 
faith in ultimate liberation must be summoned forth 
by the conquered peoples to resist Nazi rule. Am- 
bassador Grew’s recital, on August 30, of some of 
the tortures inflicted by the Japanese on American 
citizens, is but a small example of what has been 
suffered, in certain cases for years, by those subject 
to Nazi domination, including German dissenters. 
Yet information from occupied territories indicates 
growing resistance both among the peoples whom 
the Germans had hoped to exterminate—notably the 
Poles and Czechs; and among those they had hoped 
to win to the “new order’—notably the Dutch and 
Norwegians. 

WILL HATE BLOCK RECONSTRUCTION ? 
This resistance, most understandably, is generating 
a hatred against the Germans which the Americans, 
and even the British, may find it difficult to compre- 
hend fully. Any weakening of Nazi rule would be a

Air AS World War II enters its fourth year, the out- 
1D, come of the global conflict remains undecided, 
00d | with the balance inclining slightly, and as yet for the 
Ver I} most part in terms of intangibles, in favor of the 
for United Nations. Using conquered Europe as a spring- 
fMS | board, the Nazis are hammering relentlessly at Rus- 
ao sia, which three years ago had hoped to divert Nazi 
pS lightning to the west; and the Western powers are 
Hain }now experimenting with ways and means to divert 
Spit: | Nazi forces from the east back to the Western front. 
nese | While the lessons of Dieppe are being sifted for such 
d in | tues as they may yield regarding the organization of 
large-scale invasion of the European coast, British and 
mak- American air forces are blasting at German produc- 
itish tion and railroad centers, aided, from the east, by 
€sS€S J the Russian air force. It still remains to be proved, 
and however, that air raids alone, unsupported by action 
nes ton land, can succeed in breaking the Nazis’ hold on 
m Europe.

ewer | Cal juncture, Hitler would like nothing better than to 
1 € |«reate the impression that Europe has acquiesced in

light | °° the Atlantic world. To give these plans an air 
bing of reality, he intends to summon a European confer- 
and [ence in three weeks when, the Nazis claim, Russia's 
ombs | fate will have been sealed. The principal object of

also against those among the conquered who, for 
one reason or another, have acquiesced in ‘“‘collabora- 
tion.” Fear of revenge, in turn, strengthens the de- 
termination of the Nazis, and of collaborationists 
like Laval and Quisling, to uproot all potential op- 
position. 

Out of these elements of resistance and hatred, 
held down by the Nazis at the point of a gun, how 
can stability be brought to Europe? The late Italian 
historian Guglielmo Ferrero advanced the thesis that 
the French Revolution precipitated a series of “great 
panics,” in which governments that did not enjoy 
“legitimate” authority—from Napoleon to Hitler, 
Mussolini and their satellites—repressed the people, 
for fear that the people might otherwise challenge or 
destroy their authority, and that this vicious circle 
could be broken only with restoration of some form 
of “legitimacy.” If by legitimacy is meant the restora- 
tion of political and economic conditions that existed 
in Europe—or elsewhere—before 1939, then the pos- 


CAUTION REQUIRED IN JUDGING FAR EASTERN DEVELOPMENTS __ |" 


Recent events in the Solomon Islands and China 
emphasize the need for careful judgment, if the 
American public is not to make the mistake of re- 
garding battles as wars or superficial aspects of a 
problem as the problem itself. We need to appreciate 
fully the enemy's strength, without minimizing our 
own, and to understand the present role of the Far 
East in the world-wide strategy of the United Na- 
tions. After thorough consideration of the issues, 
Washington and‘London decided some months ago 
that the European front is primary in this stage of 
the war. It is clear, therefore, that at the present time 
we cannot expect to do more than hold our positions 
in Asia and bring about certain improvements of a 
limited character. Naturally, the situation may 
change if Japan becomes involved in difficulties on 
a new front or if a successful United Nations offen- 
sive in the West permits a subsequent diversion of 
men and supplies to the Far East. 

How then, are we to judge the Battle of the 
Solomons? Our forces, distinguishing themselves for 
courage and determination, have seized a number of 
important islands, beaten off a Japanese “reconnais- 
sance in force,” and damaged or destroyed a num-

sibility of stabilization would indeed appear remote; |. 
for the Nazis have swept into the discard not only P 7 
the men but frequently the institutions that ruled 


asp 
Europe, and the conquered peoples may have to c. 
begin from scratch once the war is over. sa 


But legitimacy can be interpreted in the more pro- obj 
found sense of reaffirmation of certain accepted val- tha 
ues of human conduct—what Ferrero calls “honesty” 
—which might gradually alleviate the destructive 
lack of confidence and lack of integrity, among both 
individuals and nations, that has been so character- of 
istic a phenomenon of our times. From the furnace pot 
of war, in which so many familiar objects and beliefs ) ¢, 
have been charred beyond recognition, are emerging jec 
certain values that the Nazis have not succeeded in } 4; 
destroying. In the final balance, these intangible val- | y,, 
ues may yet prove more weighty than the hatreds | 4), 
Hitler has created, and prove Europe’s most valuable pre 
contribution to post-war reconstruction. r

the trap prepared for the enemy in the related sector | op

JAPANESE WITHDRAWAL IN CHINA. While |

Although these gains are welcome, they are appar- 
ently due more to a planned Japanese withdrawal 
than to the strength of the Chinese troops or the aid ™ 
of the small United States air squadron. All through 
the war the Chinese, plagued by Jack of artillery, @ 
have found it extremely difficult to recapture walled | H 
cities. Only a deliberate Japanese evacuation, based | “ 
on a sharp reduction of the Japanese armies in East 
Central China, can explain the retaking of so many] «

rotected and unprotected towns in such a short time. 

These developments therefore have a threatening 
aspect. They suggest three possibilities, not neces- 
sarily mutually exclusive: that the Japanese troops 
were urgently required elsewhere; that the essential 
objectives of the campaign had been achieved; or 
that, in the view of the Japanese military, nothing 
further could be gained by continuance of the cam- 
paign. The first possibility would point toward Jap- 
anese action on a new major front, perhaps Siberia 
or India, for no single current sector in Asia is im- 
portant enough to necessitate the withdrawal from 
)Chekiang and Kiangsi. Or Japan’s immediate ob- 
jective may be to strengthen its present positions by 
striking on many existing fronts, for example 
Yunnan, the southwest Pacific, North China, and the 
Aleutians; but this would presumably be simply a 

relude to action elsewhere. 

The two other alternatives mentioned above deal 
with the objectives of the East Central China cam- 
paign. Clearly, the plan for a Shanghai-Singapore 
railway, which was given great prominence early this 
summer. was far beyond the scope of the Japanese 
operations. Likewise, although Japan probably de- 
sired to prevent bombings of its cities from such ex-

cellently located airfields as Chuhsien and Lishui, 
the campaign exceeded the requirements of this 
goal. It must be noted, moreover, that even though 
these bases have ‘been given up, the Japanese suc- 
ceeded in keeping them out of use during the im- 
portant summer months, which may have been all 
they were looking for. 

CHINA THE CHIEF OBJECTIVE. It still seems 
true that the main objectives of the Japanese was 
to weaken China economically and politically by 
striking at the links between two important eastern 
provinces and the heart of the interior.* This as- 
sumption is strengthened by the fact that the Jap- 
anese withdrawal began immediately after the har- 
vest in Chekiang and Kiangsi, or while it was still 
going on. As much as possible of the crop was prob- 
ably seized, and this section of Free China will doubt- 
less face a very difficult winter. On the other hand, 
comfort can be derived from the consideration that, 
if the Japanese hoped to produce immediate fissures 
in China’s political structure and spirit of resistance, 
they failed to achieve their objective.

Washington News Letter Rie, Sete 














AuG. 31.—On the third anniversary of World 
War II the outlook for the United Nations seems 
more hopeful than observers in Washington dared 
anticipate two months ago, when the Germans were 
launching their offensive in the Ukraine and Marshal 
Erwin Rommel was racing madly for Alexandria. 
When 1942 opened, it was generally considered that 
this year would be the Fuehrer’s last chance to win 
the war. Athough his armies continue to gain vic- 
tories, these are on a lesser scale than his earlier 
triumphs, and it now seems certain that the Nazis 
are not going to put Russia out of the war this year. 

The bright spot in the war picture, as seen in the 
capital, is the capture of six of the strategic Solomon 
islands by the United States Marines. Over the week- 
end, the conservative Navy Department issued a 
summary of the operations, stating that the Marines 
had consolidated their hold on the Guadalcanal- 
Tulagi area and were now engaged in mopping up 
the remnants of Japanese opposition. 

AMERICA’S FIRST OFFENSIVE VICTORY. 
The Solomon Islands fighting is a milestone, since it 
constitutes the first offensive victory won by the 
United States in World War II. Tulagi harbor and 
the Guadalcanal airfields are the first bits of territory 
wrested back from the Japanese by American troops. 
They have considerable strategic value, for the 
Solomon Islands in Japanese hands were a menace to 
our line of communication with Australia, while 
Guadalcanal is a useful base from which U.S. bomb- 
ers can attack the Japanese in New Guinea. 

But, more important perhaps than even the stra- 
tegic significance of the Solomon Islands victory is 
its psychological value. Its moral effect is comparable 
to some extent to the tonic effect of the capture of 
Fort Henry and Fort Donelson by the Federal armies 
in the spring of 1862 on public opinion in the North 
during the Civil War. Many serious reverses and 
grave disappointments lay ahead for the Unionist 
cause, but these brilliant successes were auguries of 
ultimate triumph. 

Other encouraging developments recently have 
been Brazil’s entrance into the war, the sharp reduc- 
tion in ship sinkings by Axis submarines in the At- 
lantic during July, and the fine performances of the 
Flying Fortresses, not one of which has yet been shot 
down in the now almost daily raids over Europe. 

The outstanding military surprise of the year, how- 
ever, has undoubtedly been the showing of the Chi- 
nese armies. When the Burma Road was cut last 
spring and the Japanese launched an offensive four 
months ago to gain complete control of the Hang- 


chow-Nanchang railway, grave fears were enter. 
tained that China would shortly be forced to capitu 
late. On the contrary, the amazing Chinese, by their 
unexpected counter-attack, have retaken 200 miles 
of the railway and, by regaining the airfields at 
Chuhsien and Lishui, have put the flimsy industrial 
cities of Japan within range of American bombers, 
Even if it be true, as some military critics are inclined 
to think, that the Chinese successes are due in part to | — 
withdrawal of Japanese troops for use in another | Y% 
theatre of war, possibly India or Siberia, Chiang | 
Kai-shek’s armies cannot be denied the glory of 

having won the outstanding victories of the war to | yp 
date against the Japanese. P 


DARK SPOTS. The dark spots on the war hori- J of ¢ 
zon are Russia and Egypt. The Nazi threat to gain | othe 
control of the Caucasus oil wells remains grave, and } gro 
Stalingrad, threatened as Moscow was last year, can- | tion 
not look for relief to an approaching winter as the | bef 
Russian capital could in 1941. But, whatever the out- | whc 
come of this super-Verdun battle, it is now certain— ] the 
as it was not last spring—that Russia will not be | the 
knocked out of the war as an effective fighting force | stre 
this year. Dr. Joseph Goebbels has already predicted | fj} 
a second winter campaign in Russia, and the Nazi tary 
authorities are appealing to the civilian population | Ro, 
for warm clothing for the troops. All 

More threatening is the position in Egypt, } soil 
where Marshal Rommel on August 31 launched aj (¢ 
major thrust at Alexandria, 70 miles away. Despite } exp 
losses inflicted on German and Italiai convoys in } of 
the Mediterranean by American and British bombers | par 
and by British warships, the Nazi leader is known | fep 
to have obtained considerable reinforcements in men } Ay 
and supplies of late. A Nazi conquest of Alexandria | par 
—which, by assuring the Axis complete domination | the 
of the Middle East, would jeopardize the United Na- | Gy 
tions’ supply line to Russia from the south and seri- | wa 
ously menace India from the west—would repre- | w; 
sent Hitler’s greatest succéss since the fall of France. |}, 

Still, as the summer of 1942 slips into autumn, | m, 
the conviction grows in Washington that the tide is | y} 
surely, even if almost imperceptibly, turning in favor | m, 
of the Allies. As Ambassador Joseph C. Grew, just j gi, 
returned from his post at Tokyo, broadcast on | jp, 
August 30, the Japanese will not be easy to beat but, 4 
given determination on the part of the American } 44 
people to pay the price and see the war through, it 
can be done. And what Mr. Grew said of the Jap- | th 
anese applies with equal force to the Germans. U

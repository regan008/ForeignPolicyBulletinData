been ripe for an upheaval. 

DILEMMA OF ALLIES. The dilemma that con- 
fronts the United Nations is whether they should 
now make a choice between -the conflicting elements 
in the occupied countries, giving their blessing to 
one group (and thus inviting the curses of the 
others); or, on the contrary, decline to intervene in 
these internal conflicts, and proceed with the task of 
tnilitary occupation whenever that becomes feasible, 
leaving military commanders in the field free to de- 
cide what individuals should be vested with civil 
authority until such time as a general settlement can 
be discussed. The democratic formula, and the one 
sanctioned by the Atlantic Charter, is that the peoples 
of the occupied countries shall freely choose their 
Own governments once they have been liberated from 
Nazi rule. But will the peoples of liberated coun- 
tries be in a state of mind to elect their own govern- 
ments? Or will the defeat of Germany merely un- 
leash all the old passions that, to some extent at 
least, had been kept in check by the prevailing de- 
sire to resist Hitler? And when these passions break 
loose, as they already have in Yugoslavia, will a 
serious difference of opinion develop between Britain, 
the United States and Russia as to the general trend 
that should be encouraged in any given country by 
the recognition of one type of government in prefer- 
ence to another ? 

This is not an academic question, but one of im- 
mediate urgency. There is a growing danger that

Britain and the United States may become associate 
in the minds of Europeans with representatives of 
the old order in Europe who, having failed to pr. 
vent the catastrophe of war, are already squabbling 
over the spoils of victory. It is understandable tha 
Britain and the United States should want to maip 
tain as much continuity as possible in the politic, 
life of Europe, but Hitler's ruthless conquests ma 
have made resumption of life at the point where j 
was interrupted impossible; and it may be that the 
Western democracies can make their most effectiye 
contribution to post-war reconstruction by taking % 
their starting-point not conditions as they existed ig 
1939, but as they exist today. Perhaps the only way 
to avoid a series of civil wars and inter-Allied clashes 
that would destroy what is left of Europe is to play 
now for military administration of all of liberate 
Europe by the United Nations for a specific period, 
During that period it might prove possible to carry} 
out measures of relief and rehabilitation that would 
prepare the peoples of conquered countries to make 
a relatively dispassionate choice regarding their fu 
ture political régimes, instead of thrusting this re 
sponsibility on them when they are not in a state 
of mind to fulfill it. The military representatives of | 
the United Nations, however, must have a general 
policy to guide their decisions before and after they 
enter countries now occupied by the Nazis if their) 
military operations are not to be jeopardized by politi 
cal convulsions throughout the continent.

IS CHILE NEARING BREAK WITH AXIS? 


The arrival in Washington, on December 11, of 
Sefior Radl Morales Beltrani, Chilean Minister of 
the Interior, again raises the question of Chile’s po- 
sition in the war. With the Allied successes in North 
Africa and the Solomons, it seemed that severance 
of diplomatic relations with the Axis might have 
been expected on the part of Chile and Argentina, 
the only nations on the continent still maintaining 
such ties. The drive for complete hemisphere solidar- 
ity, however, moves slowly. A year after Pearl Har-

CHILE STRIKES AT AXIS AGENTS. Although 
no fundamental change has yet occurred, Chile has | 
taken important steps recently to curb Axis espionage | 
and sabotage activities. On November 5 the Chilean 
government ordered the expulsion of one Italian and 
eleven German agents for spying. On the same day, 
a mass demonstration which supported the United 
Nations and called for a break with the Axis took | 
place in Santiago. This happened two days after the 
Inter-American Emergency Committee for Political 
Defense of the Continent at Montevideo had de 
cided to publish a memorandum presented fout | 
months before, on June 30, to the Chilean Executive 
by United States Ambassador Claude G. Bowers,

Washington News Letter 


Dec. 21.—The circumstances that brought about 
the resignation of Price Administrator Leon Hender- 
son bear a disquieting resemblance to political events 
that contributed so much to the downfall of France. 
In that country it was the predominance of group 
and class interests over considerations of national 
welfare that crippled French armaments production 
and left the nation semi-defenseless when war came. 
Here in the United States the triumph of the 
farm bloc last week in finally obtaining the over- 
throw of the man.they were avowedly ‘“‘out to get’ 
has endangered the entire price stabilization program, 
lengthened appreciably the shadow of inflation, and 
created a serious menace to the nation’s war effort. 

The reason Mr. Henderson gave for his resigna- 
tion was the state of his general physical condition 
and a “rather bad impairment” of his eyesight. Actu- 
ally, as everybody knows, it was due to the fact that 
President Roosevelt's anti-inflation program was 
doomed to fail unless Mr. Henderson went, for so 
long as that pugnacious personality remained at the 
head of the Office of Price Administration, the in- 
coming Congress would have refused to vote a single 
penny in appropriations for the OPA. Mr. Hender- 
son, in fact, had become such a dangerous political 
liability that the President, against his will, had to 
offer him as a sacrifice to Congress. 

UNPOPULARITY WITH CONGRESS. Under a 
totalitarian form of government, it is a relatively 
simple matter to impose sacrifices on a nation. A 
Dr. Schacht can deprive a nation of butter to get 
guns without having to worry about losing his job, 
so long as he retains the confidence of his Fuehrer. 
But in a democracy it is not sufficient for a high gov- 
ernment official to know his job and to possess the 
confidence of the chief executive—he must also win 
the good graces of the legislature. 

Now even most Congressmen are privately willing 
to admit that Mr. Henderson administered OPA well. 
From May 1942, when his Maximum Price Regula- 
tion went into effect, until October of this year he 
held the cost of living to a rise of only 2.6 per cent. 
Rents and clothing prices remained virtually sta- 
tionary and even food prices, over many items of 
which he had no control for a long time, went up by 
only 6.5 per cent in those six months. 

But where Mr. Henderson failed notably was to 
conciliate the body that controls the purse strings. 
When a reporter asked him recently: “What makes 


frankly attributed it to his “lack of politeness.” 
more precisely, Congress was exasperated by Mg 
Henderson’s deliberate refusal to consult its m 
bers in regard to the appointment of state OPA of 
ficials. Moreover, he antagonized two important 
groups. He made enemies of labor by his insistence 
on wage stabilization and a longer work-week. And 
he angered the farmers by clamping ceilings on the | 
prices of their products. 


The danger to the nation lies in the fact that the Vou. X 
farm bloc, having tasted blood in getting rid of its) 
arch-foe, Henderson, is now planning a new offensive 
against the price stabilization front. This pressure 
group is ready, when the new Congress convenes in '.. 
January, to jam through a bill that would force the 7 “" 
Administration to include all labor costs in the com. US 
putation of farm parity prices. Such a measure, if ‘°° 
enacted, would obviously send food prices skyrocket. doubt 
ing and wreck the President’s anti-inflation program. YY * 


CALL FOR NATIONAL SELF-DISCIPLINE ““ 
The report that the farm bloc is preparing to put key J 
through such a bill lends interest to the belief that 1:3, 
Mr. Roosevelt intends to nominate ex-Senator Pren- | 1 
tiss Brown of Michigan as Mr. Henderson’s succes ;. 4), 
sor. For it was Senator Brown who, in piloting the |; ; 0 
President's anti-inflation bill through the Senate last |: p 
autumn almost single-handed, defeated the farm | ae 
bloc’s attempt at that time to get farm labor costs | of A 
included in the parity formula. His fight against this... 
powerful pressure group cost Senator Brown his seat | a: 
in the November elections. eo 

The grave implications of the Henderson affair are 
that the American people do not realize the necessity 
of accepting sacrifices for the sake of winning the | 
war, and still believe in the possibility of carrying 
on “‘politics as usual.” This is certainly the opinion 
of nearly everybody who comes back to the United 
States from the war zones, including Capt. ‘Eddie’ 
Rickenbacker who on his return to Washington De- | ,... 
cember 19 asked for “more sacrifices” from the | ¢,., 
American public—"sacrifices that seem so small and ) 
insignificant when you've seen what those boys [of | y;... 
Guadalcanal] haven't got.” If Prentiss Brown in- | ¢,. 
tends to rely on voluntary controls instead of his 
predecessor's regulations to avert inflation, it will be 
incumbent on the American people to impose on 
themselves the self-discipline that French democracy, 
to its own destruction, so lamentably failed to display.

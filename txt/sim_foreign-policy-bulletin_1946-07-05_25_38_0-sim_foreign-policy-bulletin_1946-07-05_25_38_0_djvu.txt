SHANGHAI—American discussion of Chinese 
politics usually revolves about the problem of ne- 
gotiations between the Kuomintang and the Chinese 
Communists, almost to the exclusion of other as- 
pects of the Chinese internal political scene. This 
tendency has been particularly marked in the 
| months since General Marshall came to China, for 
| the first half of 1946 has seen the conclusion of the 
Political Consultative Conference agreements in 
January; the military reorganization accord in Feb- 
tuary, and the subsequent failure to execute these 
decisions; the outbreak of large-scale warfare in 


Manchuria; and the recently announced fifteen-day 

truce, which has now expired without a settlement. 
| Everything has seemed to hinge on whether a satis- 
factory verbal agreement can be reached, and things 
have seemed to be going well or badly according to 
the progress of discussions on political and military 
formulas of national scope. 


LOCAL POLITICS ALSO CRUCIAL. Unques- 
tionably China is urgently in need of centrally-con- 
cluded agreements among the Kuomintang, Com- 
munist Party, Democratic League and other groups; 
and no leader conscious of the country’s deep de- 
sire for peace will leave any stone unturned in the 
effort to achieve unity through discussions in Nan- 
| king. But what is abundantly clear in China, and 

far more difficult to appreciate at a distance, is the 

fact that the political situation here consists of much 
more than inter-party negotiations. Day in and day 
out, in hundreds of large and small cities and thou- 
sands of villages, actions are taken which deter- 
mine the fundamental political atmosphere of the 
country. Democratic resolutions drawn up in the 
national capital can hardly be worth the paper they 
are written on unless the political life of local com- 
munities is reasonably consistent with the idea of 


j

democratic unity. As a result, the possibilities of 
establishing an all-party government in China can 
probably be observed more clearly by turning the 
microscope on local conditions than by focusing 
attention on wider aspects of Communist-Kuomin- 
tang rivalry. 

Recently the dominant political tendency in the 
leading urban centers has been toward increasing 
control of the thoughts and actions of the individual 
citizen. In such widely-separated cities as Canton, 
Sian, and Chengtu the offices of liberal newspapers 
have been attacked and damaged by anonymous 
bands, whose members have gone unpunished. The 
tension has probably been greatest in Sian, leading 
city of the Northwest, where a liberal newspaper, 
whose office was first attacked and later literally 
besieged, suspended publication. The editor of an- 
other Sian newspaper was shot to death in the streets. 


One of the chief hurdles facing any new publi- 
cation is the problem of registration, for without of- 
ficial permission from the Bureau of Social Affairs 
publication is illegal, although newspapers and 
magazines may generally be issued for the brief 
period in which permission is pending. Recently in 
Peiping over seventy publications were banned, and 
the local Publishers Federation subsequently issued 
a statement, protesting against the general difficul- 
ties faced by the press throughout China. The de- 
mand was made that persons involved in physical 
attacks on newspaper offices be severely punished 
and that the local authorities be held responsible. 
Of the publications recently banned three were is- 
sued by the Communists, while the rest have repre- 
sented other points of view. In general, it is clear 
that while the system of direct press censorship was 
abolished in China some time ago, the problem of 
press freedom remains a significant one.

BRITAIN CONTINUES BULK BUYING OF 
COTTON. Parliament on March 28 approved the 
decision of the British Board of Trade to close the 
Liverpool Cotton Exchange permanently and retain 
the system of bulk buying through the Cotton Im- 

rt Board, which was established at the beginning 
of the war. The British thereby decreed the demise 
of a private trading organization that for several 
decades has been a center of world trade in cotton. 
Whereas spinners formerly protected themselves 
from price fluctuations by dealing in futures on the 
Liverpool exchange, henceforth trading risks will 
continue to be borne by the government. Sellers of 
cotton, for their part, must do business with a single 
buyer in the British market. Britain is engaged in 
similar state trading in other commodities—sugar, 
paper, sisal, timber and food; but the decision on

import requirements of the five-year reconstruction 
program. In the meantime, resumption of private 
trade will be facilitated by formation of import 
groups, industry by industry, under direction of the 
government. These groupements will engage in bulk 
buying in their particular fields, and are therefore 
just as capable of making exclusive purchase con- 
tracts as are state trade agencies. Their potential- 
ities in that respect were recognized in the recent 
credit negotiations; accordingly, in section IV of 
the loan agreement of May 28, groupements were 
given a temporary status, to be abolished as soon as 
difficulties of transport and distribution in France 
have been overcome. The French also agreed to con- 
tinue curtailment of government procurement in the 
United States. Harotp H. HuTCHESON

cotton has peculiar significance since it permanently 
closes a market hitherto frequently traded in by na- 
tionals of other countries. 

The government justified its decision in terms of 
national interest, and rejected the criticism expressed 
in some quarters that the program violates the spirit 
of the American loan agreement. There are some in- 
dications, however, that the British may not have 
purely economic considerations in view. The editors 
of The Manchester Guardian, endorsing the perma- 
nent suspension of private trade in cotton, stated 
frankly that ‘““With our overseas obligations as they 
are it may well happen, unfortunately, that our pur- 
chases of cotton may sometimes be dictated by other 
than the purely economic considerations which have 
governed them in the past.” 

FRENCH PROMISE RETURN TO PRIVATE 
TRADE. Although both Britain and France have 
nominally socialist governments, the French unlike 
the British have indicated a desire to restore private 
trade as soon as it is feasible. As early as September 
1945 the Provisional government authorized a lim-

Population and Peace in the Pacific, by Warren S. Thomp- 
son. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1946. $3.75 
Believing that the development of the Pacific peoples in 

the next few decades may determine whether we will have 

a third world war, the author analyzes in detail the heavy 

population pressures throughout most of the Far East and 

pleads for the ending of European control of Far Eastern

Japanese Militarism: Its Cause and Cure, by John M. 
Maki. New York, Knopf, 1945. $3.00 


An enlightened discussion by a Japanese-American, 
based on the view that the elimination of Japanese aggres-

and social conditions that have created Japanese militar- 
ism and aggression have been eliminated.” The historical 
sections, presenting the long-term background of the Jap-

$3.75 
This book admirably sets forth the pros and cons of in- 

ternational investment, particularly the post-war pros- 

pects. The subject is treated in a nontechnical manner, 
and is developed from the point of view of the United 

States as the leading creditor nation. The author minimizes 

the importance of foreign lending in the maintenance of 

a high level of income in the United States. He states 

clearly the implications of large post-war loans, concludes 

that such a program may not be desirable for several 
reasons and outlines alternatives.

of French imports would continue to be handled 
by the government, a policy dictated by the large

Washington News Letter sation 


However useful the testing of atomic power at 
Bikini Atoll on June 30 may prove to scientists and 
military strategists, the vast experiment will be fully 
justified only if it focuses world attention on the im- 
portance of controlling atomic energy. To no group 
will the findings at Bikini be more crucial than to 
the individuals charged with framing foreign policy 
of the great powers. In the case of America this 
means the United States Senate, as well as the White 
House and the State Department. Since Bernard 
Baruch’s presentation on June 14 of this country’s 
proposals to the United Nations Atomic Energy 
Commission, members of the upper house in Wash- 
ington have been considering whether they want to 
change their attitude toward the use of the veto 
power in deliberations of the Security Council. For 
the ultimate fate of the Baruch plan depends not 
alone on whether the United Nations accept it, but 
on whether the Senate approves it. Baruch said that 
the United States decision within the Atomic Energy 
Commission would be “subject, of course, to our con- 
stitutional processes.’ The Constitution requires that 
treaties have the approval of two-thirds of the Sen- 


ators voting before this country becomes a party to 
them. 


SENATE AND VETO. Baruch has forced both 
the UN and the Senate to reconsider the veto by 
telling the Atomic Energy Commission that “there 
must be no veto to protect those who violate their 
solemn agreements not to develop or use atomic 
energy for destructive purposes.” At the San Fran- 
cisco Conference of the United Nations, the United 
States delegation insisted that the Charter contain 
the veto because President Truman and Secretary 
of State Edward R. Stettinius, Jr. feared that the 
Senate would reject a Charter lacking a veto, which 
the Senators on the United States delegation regard- 
ed as a device for protecting American sovereignty. 


Despite occasional public statements from a few 
of their colleagues in favor of some limitation of 
national sovereignty (like that made to the Foreign 
Policy Association by Senator Fulbright, Democrat, 
of Arkansas, last October 20), most Senators have 
continued to favor the maintenance of the veto 
power. Uncertainty about the reception which one- 
third plus one of the Senators would give to his 
veto proposal will weaken Mr. Baruch’s argument 
before the Atomic Energy Commission. President 
Truman on June 28 pledged his full support to 
Baruch, and on the same day Baruch announced 


WILL BIKINI TESTS STRENGTHEN BARUCH’S EFFORTS TO CURB VETO? 


the 12 members of the Commission were not who 
in agreement with the 20 key points of the Ame 
ican plan. 

BIKINI AND SENATE. Since the dropping 
the atomic bombs last August on Hiroshima anf 
Nagasaki, Senators have found that a large part of 
the public is apathetic about the whole issue of 
atomic energy. Now that new tests of the use of — 
atomic bombs at sea have begun, there may be a re _ - 
vival of interest in the crucial problems which cop

While many Americans have criticized the tests 4 |

whether the first of the Bikini tests will serve thi) {? 
purpose. The final results of the Bikini experiment June ;

to the damage already wrought in Japan and that : z 
which is likely to follow from an underwater atomic " re 
explosion, planned for the near future, the June 4 allott 
results may appear negligible.

RUSSIA’S NEED FOR GOODS. It would be 
easier to deal with these problems if it could be as- 
sumed that Russia’s principal objective in Eastern Eu- 
rope and the Balkans is to disrupt the economies of 
the Axis satellites in order to pave the way for their 
communization and possibly their eventual integra- 
tion into the U.S.S.R. As a matter of fact, however, 
Russia actually needs all the food, consumers’ goods

and industrial machinery it can obtain to fill the 
needs of its own population. It is willing to pay for 
imports when necessary, as indicated by its trade 
negotiations with Denmark and Sweden. From the 
point of view of the United States, it is unfair for 
Russia to obtain goods from the Axis satellites with- 
out compensation, as it is doing through the collec- 
tion of reparations. It must be borne in mind, how- 
ever, that the United States, whose industrial produc- 
tion was wastly expanded as a result of the war, and 
which suffered no loss of industrial equipment or 
raw materials, does not need reparations, and in any 
case would probably not want to import most of the 
manufactured goods produced in that area. 


At the same time, the Russians themselves are be- 
ginning to realize that their methods of collecting 
reparations cannot, over the long run, win them the 
sympathy of the peoples of occupied countries. They 
will thus be confronted with the problem of either 
withdrawing their occupation forces and moderat- 
ing their economic demands, or else of increasing 
military pressure on their neighbors. What is more 
serious for Russia, mere draining of the resources of 
these countries, without some attempt at their replen- 
ishment and development, will eventually amount 
to killing the goose that laid the golden egg. While 
collection of reparations may tide Russia over the 
arduous first year of readjustment at home, ulti- 
mately there is bound to come a condition of dimin- 
ishing returns in obtaining manufactured goods that 
Russia will urgently need for years to come. 


The resentment felt in occupied countries against 
Russia, however, should not be exaggerated. Many 
of the economic and social changes effected in the 
wake of Russian occupation had been advocated 
long before 1939 by political groups, by no means 
all Communists, who are now in power. If Russia 
can find some way of offering these countries a 
steady market for goods they may not find it pos- 
sible to sell to the United States, it may eventually 
earn the support of large sections of their popula- 
tions. This, for example, seems to be the result of the 








provision in the Italian draft peace treaty concernig 
the payment by Italy of $100,000,000 worth of rep, 
rations to the U.S.S.R., part of which is to come gy, Nan! 
of current production, with Russia supplying th} Ck 
raw materials. Reports from Italy indicate that thj polit 
Italians, profoundly disillusioned by the failure ¢ 
Britain and the United States to support their cou} |atio 
try in the peace negotiations, and to bolster it as 
potential bulwark against further Russian advancg  pasis 
in the Balkans and the Adriatic, are beginning | did 

wonder whether they should not have sought th! mer 
backing of Russia. 


RESTORATION vs. DESIRE FO, ! 
CHANGE. Underlying the economic tug of war be #09 
tween Russia and the Western powers is the unre mak 
solved conflict all over Europe between those who & 
favor restoration of pre-1939 values and institutions of t 
and those who had hoped that the war would bring, 4%

SUPPORT OF CHINESE LIBERALS WOULD STRENGTHEN U.S. POSITION 


SHANGHAI—United States policy in China cannot So far, however, the political initiative in China 





be understood or appraised without considering the 
extent to which it is affected by the state of Amer- 
ican-Russian relations. Since Japan’s surrender near- 
ly a year ago relations between the United States 
and Russia in general have been tense both in China 
and the world at large. Moscow’s policy in Man- 
churia has produced an unfavorable impression in 
the United States, while America’s powerful influ- 
ence over the Central Chinese government has 
aroused suspicion in Russia. Each country fears that 
the other wants to control China and to use it in 
future military operations. 


has been taken by the United States. An American, 
not a Russian, general came to China to mediate; 
American, not Russian, military equipment has | 
poured into China; Washington, not Moscow, is the| 
capital toward which the Central Chinese govern 
ment looks for economic and political support. This 
means not only that the United States has had an 
extraordinary opportunity to extend its power it 
China, but that it has assumed extraordinary risks. | 
At the same time, it should be pointed out that the 
Central government is recognized by Russia, 4 |

even sympathy extended by Russia to Chinese Com- 
munists opposing that government is regarded in 
Nanking as an unfriendly act. 


CHAMPIONS OF STATUS QUO? In using its 

litical initiative in China the United States, while 
inevitably aware of the problems posed by its re- 
lations with the U.S.S.R., could make no greater 
mistake than to act solely, or even largely, on the 
basis of these relations as they exist at present. If it 
did so, it would be following a negative policy of 
merely opposing another power. What is needed is 
a positive policy of judging the Chinese situation 
on its own intrinsic merits and supporting, in ac- 
tions as well as words, the groups that are likely to 
make this country the more prosperous, more mod- 
ern nation it needs to be for its own sake and that 
of the world. In China, as in many countries, deeply 
anti-Russian sentiment and hostility toward modi- 
fication of the internal status quo frequently go hand 
in hand. Consequently, alignment with the anti- 
Russian elements in China would be virtually 
synonymous with opposition to agrarian reforms, 
civil liberties and enlightened economic policies, de- 
sired by a large section of the nation. 

The strength of the United States is so great that 
we can make mistakes and not pay for them imme- 
diately, but it would be dangerous to think that mis- 
takes carry no price. In the long run the Chinese 
people will be alienated from any one who supports 
the less enlightened elements in their country. It is 
therefore important to grasp without delay the les- 
son that many of us have not yet learned: that in 
foreign relations financial aid is a wholly inade- 
quate substitute for political understanding of the 
peoples with whom we are dealing. The more we 
encourage democracy in China and actively oppose 
the militaristic pro-civil war elements, the more will 
American influence grow. But to back unpopular 
leaders for reasons of international policy is the most 
certain method of turning the Chinese people away 
from the United States. 

SEEKING A COMMON GROUND. As a matter 
of fact, a policy of increasing American prestige

through encouragement of progressive Chinese 
groups would have a beneficial effect on American- 
Russian relations. It cannot be assumed that the 
United States and the Soviet Union will define 
“progressive groups” in precisely the same fashion, 
but an understanding that militaristic elements on 
either side favoring policies that lead to civil war 
are not included in this phrase would help to create 
a common ground for cooperation. At present our 
actions encourage militaristic leaders in the Central 
government, although our stated policy is quite 
properly one of conditional support of that govern- 
ment premised on the achievement of democratic 
unity and a coalition government. 

The United States does not want a Communist 
government in power in China, but if there is to be 
any true coalition régime, the Chinese Communists, 
who have taken the lead in agrarian and many other 
reforms, will inevitably play an important role. Yet 
it would be extremely shortsighted to see the Chi- 
nese situation only in terms of two extremes—the 
Kuomintang right wing and the Communists—and 
to overlook the great mass of Chinese people, as 
well as many leaders, who stand in between. In the 
ranks of the government, the Kuomintang, the lib- 
eral Democratic League, and the non-partisans there 
are large numbers of men and women who, because 
of their democratic political philosophy, love of 
country, and the instinct of self-preservation, are 
deeply opposed to civil war. They desire, in vary- 
ing degrees, to see an all-party Chinese government 
follow the path of reform. 

Persons in this group who serve in the govern- 
ment or the Kuomintang do not hold controlling 
positions, but they would be stronger if American 
actions did not encourage their opponents. The 
United States is unquestionably right in wishing to 
preserve the form of the Central government as the 
framework for a new Chinese unity, but it would 
be an error to identify this structure with the gov- 
ernmental leaders who happen to prevail at any par- 
ticular time, just as it would be a mistake to regard 
the United States government as the peculiar prop- 
erty of any specific leaders or political party. It is 
clear, however, that with every passing day our 
policy of large-scale material support of the powers- 
that-be in China is driving the middle group either 
to the right or to the left and making the alternatives 
in this country sharper than before.

PARTITION NO SOLUTION OF PALESTINE PROBLEM 


The proposal of the Anglo-American Cabinet 
Committee that the United States and the United 
Kingdom undertake to partition Palestine into Jew- 
ish, Arab and central federal states poses a difficult 
political problem for President Truman. It also 
raises again the possibility of further delay in rescu- 
ing even a small number of central Europe’s Jewry. 
Moreover, because of objections already voiced by 
both Zionists and Arabs to partition of Palestine, 
the new plan will further embitter the troubled 
Middle Eastern area. 

PROBLEM OF THE 100,000. The proposal in 
the form the Committee submitted it to the United 
States government on July 25 would probably reduce 
to a minimum the disturbing anti-Semitic outbursts 
of the Arabs and the violent anti-Britishism of the 
Zionist Terrorists. For it would limit forever the 
Jewish immigration to Palestine by limiting the 
space that Jews can occupy, thereby ending both Jew- 


_ ish hopes that violence might win them concessions, 


and Arab fears of Jewish domination. But it would 
force the postponement, perhaps forever, of the 
emigration from Europe of Jews in the displaced 
persons’ camps. It would also jeopardize the pros- 
pects of the 100,000 Jews whom President Truman 
last September requested British Prime Minister 
Attlee to admit at once into Palestine, and to whom, 
according to the Anglo-American Committee of In- 
quiry on April 20, certificates of immigration should 
be issued “immediately.” 

The President made his proposal to Attlee for 
the immigration of 100,000 more because of his 
concern for Europe than for the Middle East. Yet 
the Cabinet Committee proposals would authorize 
the migration of the 100,000 only after it is decided 
that the partition and the other suggested consti- 
tutional arrangements will be put into effect. This 
postponement not only links the immigration to 
constitutional reform, whereas Truman had advo- 
cated it as a separate step, but endangers the possi- 
bility that this immigration will ever take place. 
Should the constitutional arrangements proposed by 
the partition plan go into effect, future Arab sup- 
port in the federal government for further Jewish 
immigration would be most unlikely. 

For those reasons, it is possible that Truman will 
accept the Cabinet Committee proposals only on 
condition that the migration of the 100,000 is au- 
thorized at once. The obstacles in the way of such 
a recommendation are that Henry F. Grady, the rep- 
resentative of Secretary of State James F. Byrnes on 
the Committee, has strongly advocated American 





acceptance of the proposals in their present form, 
and that President Truman has not in the past in. 
dicated he would provide the military support 
which Prime Minister Attlee has asked the United 
States to give to Britain if the 100,000 migrate. Yet 
another obstacle is the fact that the Office of Near 
Eastern and African Affairs in the State Department, 
which deals with Palestine, has in the past been out 
of sympathy with the proposal for the migration of 
100,000, which Truman submitted to Attlee with. 
out the knowledge of that Office. At present, the 
British permit the migration of 1,500 Jews a month 
into Palestine. 


PLAN OF BRITISH ORIGIN. Secretary of State 
Byrnes discussed the London proposals with Prime 
Minister Attlee in Paris last weekend. Truman will 
receive Mr. Byrnes’ recommendations and, after | 
study of their political implications in Europe, the | 
Middle East and the United States, will either ac. | 
cept them or, as at present seems likely, propose 
their modification. The suggestion for partition came 
from the British members of the Cabinet Commit. 
tee, although the British government ten years ago 
turned down another partition proposed by the Peel | 
Commission. The new proposals have their origin in | 
the statement which British Foreign Secretary Ernest 
Bevin made last November 13, to the effect that 
Palestine in time will become a self-governing Pal- | 
estinian, not Jewish, state. The mandate under | 
which Britain administers the government affairs of , 
Palestine calls on the mandatory to “secure the es: | 
tablishment of the Jewish national home’’ and also 
to protect the “civil and religious rights’”—but not 
the political rights—‘‘of all the inhabitants of 
Palestine.” 

There is little hope that Britain’s new plan will | 
“solve” the Palestine problem. For by now most ob- 
servers are keenly aware that there may be no final, 
all-embracing solution which can be regarded 4 
realistic in terms of Middle Eastern politics. The 
Cabinet Committee’s plans must now be submitted | 
to both Jewish and Arab representatives, but it is 
doubtful whether joint discussions will follow. The 
new turn of events in the mandate, like those in 
Egypt, demonstrate Britain’s determination to devise 
some more permanent arrangement. Perhaps undet | 
the circumstances Jews and Arabs will be ready to 
adopt a modified partition scheme. On the other 
hand, the whole issue may yet be submitted to the , 
United Nations, either by the Arabs or some other 
member nation.

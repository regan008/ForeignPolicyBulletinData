WAR PACTS OPEN NEW CHAPTER IN U.S.-MEXICAN RELATIONS 


[¢ IS now nearly four months since Mexico, aroused 

by the sinking of two of its tankers by German 
submarines, declared war on May 30, 1942 on Ger- 
many and its Axis partners. During that period, our 
southern neighbor has taken various measures to in- 
crease its contribution to the war effort of the United 
Nations. Its chief contribution is and will remain 
economic in character. Mexico will continue to 
supply the war industries of the United States with 
badly needed raw materials, especially metallic ores 
and concentrates. But belligerent Mexico is now also 
offering other economic and military advantages to 
its allies. 

MILITARY PREPARATIONS. From the military 
point of view, the main advantage of Mexico’s entry 
into the war is that the land, sea and air defense of 
the vulnerable Mexican Pacific Coast can be under- 
taken jointly by the United States and Mexico. In 
this way the April 3, 1941 agreement for the recipro- 
cal use of air bases is conveniently enlarged. To pre- 
pare this defense, as well as to meet any menace to 
the country or its southern neighbor, Guatemala, 
President Manuel Avila Camacho on August 18 
signed a decree introducing compulsory military 
service for men from 18 to 45 years of age. Although 
the number of men called will necessarily be small 
at the beginning because of lack of equipment, the 
new decree nevertheless provides the necessary basis 
for gradual development of a modern Mexican army. 
It is supplemented by the acquisition in the United 
States, under lend-lease agreements, of war matériel, 
including several bomber planes; the building of 
military barracks near Mexico City and in Cuer- 
navaca; and the appropriation, announced on Sep- 
tember 11, of seven million pesos (or some $1,440,- 
000) for the purchase of 150 torpedo boats of the 
“Mosquito” type, indicating a sizable increase in sea 
defenses. (Before its entry into the war, Mexico's 
navy was reported to have three 2,000-ton gunboats 


and eleven patrol vessels.) Finally, the appointment 
on September 1, of former President Lazaro Cardenas 
to the post of Minister of National Defense will as- 
sure popular support to future war measures that 
may be taken by the Mexican government. 
FINANCIAL COOPERATION. One of the latest 
steps in the development of Mexican-United States 
financial relations is the agreement of August 13 
prohibiting the circulation within Mexico of all 
American paper currency except $2 bills. This agree- 
ment has stopped the use of Mexico as a clearing- 
house for American currency confiscated by the Axis 
in Europe and sold back to the United States. Other 
steps of an economic character include the allocation 
of various United States loans for the development 
of such war activities as expansion of mining out- 
put, construction of steel mills, earmarking of the 
total guayule rubber output for the United States 
through 1946, extension of the Pan-American Aigh- 
way from Mexico City to the Guatemalan border, 
and improvement of the Mexican railroad network. 
This latter is overloaded because of increased ship- 
ments of goods due to a decrease in seaborne traffic 
through the submarine-infested Gulf of Mexico. 
SUPPLYING OF MAN POWER. Another valu- 
able economic contribution by Mexico to the produc- 
tive capacity of the United Nations is the agreement 
concluded with the United States in August, in which 
Mexico undertook to send several thousand agri- 
cultural workers into our harvest fields. This pact 
is especially interesting because it may open the way 
for a new kind of international labor exchange. As 
Vice President Henry A. Wallace stressed in the 
speech he delivered in Spanish at Los Angeles on 
September 18 in ceremonies marking Mexico’s In- 
dependence Day, the Mexican workers will be 
brought into the United States “not on the basis of 
low wage competition, as in the past, but with the 
wholehearted assistance and protection of the two 


ae 


governments.”” The new agreement provides a mini- 
mum wage of 30 cents an hour for the Mexican 
laborers, a figure somewhat above the average paid 
to farmhands in the southwestern states, where most 
of the Mexican workers will be sent. This provision 
is expected to eliminate employers whose only aim 
is exploitation of cheap labor. 

The agreement also covers transportation and re- 
patriation costs, and indicates that the workers are 
to be furnished with living quarters and board. In 
addition, it stipulates that they shall benefit from ac- 
cident insurance, provides for medical care, schools, 
and freedom from military service. This last point 
is particularly important in view of the Nazi word- 
of-mouth propaganda, still strong in Mexico, which 
tries to obstruct this form of collaboration by spread- 
ing rumors that Mexican workers going to the United 
States will be drafted into the American army, never 
to come back. 

The Mexican government, for its part, appears 
anxious to make this experiment in “‘planned’’ sea- 
sonal migration a success of permanent benefit for 
the nation. With this end in view, it is studying a 
system whereby the temporarily expatriated agricul- 
tural workers would be able to save a substantial per- 
centage of their earnings and invest it in farm im- 
plements purchased in the United States. On their 
return home, the Mexican government would supply 
these landless workers with land on which they 
could use their new farm machinery and start an in- 
dependent life. 

It is too soon as yet to judge the results of this

plan; only a short time has elapsed since the agree. 
ment was signed, and there- has been no rush to 
employ Mexican workers, although for several 
months California and Texas growers have been 
calling for Mexican farmhands. The new agreement 
might well mark the starting point of a new era in 
United States-Latin American relations—an era in 
which the welfare of the people in the countries in- 
volved will come ahead of the vested interests of 
economic groups. If it succeeds, even on a small scale, 
it could do more to create sympathy for the United 
States in Latin America than anything else. In coun- 
tries where the largest part of the rural population 
does not read, concrete deeds are a far more effective 
means of propaganda than printed material. 


ERNEST S. HEDIGER 


{Mr. Hediger has just returned from a month's visit to 
Mexico. During his stay there he delivered three lectures in 
Spanish at the National University of Mexico, on the special 
invitation of the Rector of the University. Two of these 
lectures were on Nazi Exploitation of Occupied Europe, a 
subject covered by Mr. Hediger in ForEIGN Poticy Re- 
PorTS for June 1 and August 15, 1942, and one on Stra. 
tegical Raw Materials and the War. The lectures were at- 
tended by a large audience composed of high military offi- 
cials, representatives of various government departments, 
bankers, professors at the School of Economics, and stu- 
dents, iol were broadcast over the University radio station 
throughout Mexico and Latin America. In response to the 
interest aroused by these lectures, the University of Mexico 
is publishing them in pamphlet form. In addition, the full 
Spanish text of Mr. Hediger’s two ForgEIGN Poticy Re- 
PORTS will be published in book form by Ediciones Minerva 
of Mexico City.} 


SECOND FRONT ISSUE UNRESOLVED AS 1942 WANES 


While the gigantic struggle for control of the ruins 
of Stalingrad waxed and waned, Allied censorship 
permitted the partial unveiling of another struggle 
—that waged by Britain and the United States, on 
the one hand, and the Soviet Union on the other, 
concerning the opening of a second front in West- 
ern Europe. Stripped of diplomatic language, the 
issue is not whether a second front is desirable 
(Washington and London, in identical statements 
issued on June 12, agreed as to “the urgent tasks of 
creating a second front in Europe in 1942”), but 
whether at this time it is feasible. The Russians,

fighting against desperate odds, believe that the Al- 
lies, who have hitherto expended a far smaller num- 
ber of lives, have enough men for a land attack on 
the Germans. In this, Moscow tends to minimize 
or overlook the difficulties—with which they are 
unfamiliar—of transporting men and material over 
an expanse of water. By contrast the British, who. at 
this juncture would have to bear the brunt of an as- 
sault on Nazi-controlled Europe, believe that the 
practical possibility of invasion should be carefully 
weighed before committing the United Nations to 
what might prove a common disaster. 

CANADA’S REPORT ON DIEPPE. The cau- 
tiousness of the British—which, it is believed, has 
the approval of Canadian and American military 
leaders in the British Isles—finds support in the of- 
ficial report issued by Canada’s Defense Minister, 
J. L. Ralston, on September 18. This report reveals 
that the Canadian contingent, the major component 
of the Allied raiding force, suffered a 67 per cent 
loss in dead, wounded and missing; that the Atlantic 
coast has been heavily fortified by the Germans; 
and that the element of surprise, essential for the

Washington News Letter 


SEPT. 21.—Relations between the United States 
and Vichy, which have been steadily deteriorating 
since Pierre Laval returned to power on April 15, 
dropped to a new low on September 15 when Secre- 
tary of State Cordell Hull bluntly denounced the pro- 
Nazi politician’s decree for the conscription of French 
labor to work in German war factories as ‘wholly 
inconsistent with France’s obligations under interna- 
tional law.” The sternness of Mr. Hull’s admonition 
made it clear that any attempt by Vichy to draft 
hundreds of thousands of skilled French workers for 
service in Nazi munition plants would be considered 
by the United States government as an overt act of 
hostility, and would be followed by severance of 
diplomatic ties. 


Shortage of Nazi man power, which becomes stead- 
ily more acute as Hitler keeps throwing Germans into 
the holocaust in Russia, is one of the vital factors 
on which the United Nations are counting to break 
the German war machine. A move by Laval to re- 
lieve the drainage on German man power by sending 
French slave labor into the Reich would be consid- 
ered in Washington as much of an act of deliberate 
hostility as the handing over of the French fleet to 
the Nazis. In fact, the quasi-official Army and Navy 
Journal declares that “the peril from the fleet is 
secondary to that which would result from the gen- 
eral use of French labor in Axis factories.” 


THIRD REPUBLIC HEARD AGAIN. Fear of 
the political consequences of Laval’s latest collabora- 
tion project probably lay behind the grave warning 
addressed to Marshal Pétain and Pierre Laval by 
Jules Jeanneney, president of the French Senate, and 
Edouard Herriot, president of the Chamber of Depu- 
ties. In this communication, published in the Ameri- 
can press on September 10, the two eminent political 
leaders of the defunct Third Republic told Pétain 
that if, without authorization of the Parliament, he 
were to “try to draw France into war against our 
allies which you yourself declared ‘honor forbids,’ 
we by this letter protest in advance in the name of 
national sovereignty.” 

It is characteristic of the anomalous relations now 
existing between Washington and Vichy that on Sep- 
tember 11 Secretary Hull publicly extolled the “rare 
courage” of the two French parliamentarians who in 
the same letter had taxed Pétain with assuming un- 
authorized dictatorial powers. Other recent develop- 
ments reflecting the growing tension between the 


FOR VICTORY ° 


Administration and the Vichy government were Mr. 
Hull’s scathing denunciation on September 15 of the 
mass expulsion of Jewish refugees from unoccupied 
France; the State Department’s endorsement on Sep. 
tember 10 of the British move to occupy all of 
Madagascar; and Washington’s curt rejection on Sep. 
tember 8 of Laval’s protest against American bomb. 
ing raids over France. 


WILL U.S. ACT ON DAKAR? If the break with 
Vichy really should occur this time, it may well arise 
over Dakar, whose strategic importance has been 
greatly enhanced by Brazil’s entrance into the war. 
United States military authorities are pressing for 
the occupation of this French West African port and 
their organ, the Army and Navy Journal, hinted in 
this week’s issue that “events may compel us to co- 
operate with the British in seizing that base because 
it might serve as a jumping off place for planes op- 
erating against our South American ally.” 

The Army has little patience with the ‘‘appease- 
ment policies” of the State Department. According 
to information available in diplomatic circles in 
Washington, there are no German troops in Dakar. 
Following a visit of Pierre Boisson, Governor Gen- 
eral of French West Africa to Vichy, the Pétain- 
Laval government on September 1 formally denied 
that Germany had asked for bases in Dakar. The 
French collaborationist press, however, has been pre- 
paring French opinion for a clash over Dakar by 
references to the “Anglo-American menace to our 
African Empire.” 

The United States Army and Navy do not want 
to take any chances. They are weary of the inter- 
minable negotiations that the State Department has 
been conducting since May 9 with Admiral Georges 
Robert, Vichy High Commissioner, for the guaran- 
teeing of the neutrality of France’s Caribbean pos- 
sessions. The Army asserts, too, that the British got 
nowhere when from May to September they sought 
to negotiate a settlement with the Vichy authorities 
in Madagascar to prevent that island from being 
used as a base for Nazi submarines. 

Meanwhile, British action in Madagascar, of which 
the French National Committee in London was noti- 
fied in advance, has had the indirect effect of lessen- 
ing the tension that had developed between General 
de Gaulle and British authorities in the Levant over 
the situation in the French mandate of Syria.

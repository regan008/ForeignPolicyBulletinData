LONDON STALEMATE REVEALS HURDLES CONFRONTING PEACEMAKERS 


WASHINGTON.—The Administration in Washing- 
ton does not share the gloomy disappointment that 
characterizes most newspaper reports and comment 
on the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers 
in London. It cannot be denied, however, that the 
sessions of the Council, which opened on Septem- 


ber 11, produced no agreement on any of the issues 


directly to} which were considered by the Foreign Ministers of

by any means other than a conference restricted to 
the Big Three. For, despite Foreign Commissar 
Molotov’s agreement that France and China could 
be present at all sessions and that France should 
vote on the Italian peace treaty and the French plan 
for the control of the Ruhr, he later withdrew his 
consent to this arrangement. The Potsdam agree- 
ment, according to Mr. Molotov, excluded France 
and China from treaty discussions since they had not 
been armistice signatories. When the United States, 
Britain and France refused to accept this view, the 
| meeting reached an impasse, and compromise pro- 
posals offered by Mr. Byrnes and Mr. Bevin failed 
to break the stalemate. Yet despite this disappoint- 
ing situation, none of the Allies has shown an in- 
clination to abandon international councils in favor 
of a lone-wolf policy. 

MUTUAL SUSPICIONS. Since the United Na- 
tions conference for world organization held last 
spring in San Francisco, the powers have been 
plagued by an impossible paradox—a belief that 
world affairs can be managed partly by the formula 
of Great-Power equal cooperation and universal re- 
sponsibility, and partly by the old balance-of-power 
| formula. Continued reliance on a contradictory 

set of policies, national and international, would 

assure the failure of future conferences and destroy 


| 


the doctrine of cooperation. Sharply aware of this 
possibility, the State Department probably will op- 
pose unilateral acquisition by this country of the 
islands formerly mandated to Japan. The conference 
of the Foreign Ministers of the American Republics, 
to open at Rio de Janeiro on October 20, may be used 
by the State Department as an occasion for seeing 
to it that the Act of Chapultepec is geared into an 
international system. 

Secretary of State James F. Byrnes left for the 
London meeting determined to press for solutions to 
problems by formulae of international cooperation. 
Nevertheless, he fed the controversy between the ad- 
vocates of single-handed and cooperative action by 
letting it be known that he favored permitting Italy 
to administer its former African colonies as trustee 
for the United Nations. Later Byrnes reversed his 
position, and the draft memorandum on Italy, pre- 
sented to the meeting by the United States on Sep- 
tember 15, therefore adhered strictly to an interna- 
tionalist formula. It urged that Libya and Eritrea be 
granted their independence after a 10-year trustee- 
ship period under an administrator appointed by the 
Trusteeship Council and assisted by an advisory com- 
mittee of seven, including an Italian representative. 
For Italian Somaliland, a similar arrangement was 
proposed, but without any fixed date for inde- 
pendence. 

CONFUSED INTERNATIONALIST THINK- 
ING. Demonstrations of faith in the United Nations 
formula at the meeting in the Lancaster House ball- 
room were insufficient to allay suspicions so long as 
strong mistrust existed outside Lancaster House. The 
United States and Britain found it difficult to accept 
in full faith the Soviet espousal of cooperation when 
Moscow newspapers were objecting to Western criti- 
cism of the one-party régimes in Bulgaria and Ru- 
mania as undemocratic. The U.S.S.R. also found it

difficult to rest its hopes for security on cooperation 
with Britain and the United States at the very time 
strong voices in France and Britain were advocating 
creation of a Western bloc of states and as long as 
the United States hesitated to share its atom bomb 
secret with the Soviet Union. Retention of this secret 
strikes the Russians as evidence either of fear of 
Russia or of bad intentions toward that country. 

The United States, as a matter of fact, has grow- 
ing confidence in its ability to get along with Russia, 
but dispatches from London report profound British 
apprehension. The weekly commentary distributed by 
the official British Information Services for Septem- 
ber 28 proposes that the United States and Britain 
act together to withstand Soviet diplomacy. Soviet- 
British mistrust at London was intensified by the 
seeming eagerness of the Russians to retain unmo- 
lested their influence over the affairs of the eastern 
European countries and by British anxiety to main- 
tain a special position in the Mediterranean and 
Red Seas.

As reports of a mounting crisis in Buenos Aires 
reach the United States, it daily becomes more evi- 
dent that the only alternative to civil war in Argen- 
tina is decisive international action to dislodge the 
Farrell-Per6n government. That the Argentine im- 
broglio has assumed such unusual importance in the 
international scene is perhaps due to the fact that 
the world has seldom seen so striking a spectacle 
of a people and a government standing embattled 
against each other. Now that an abortive revolution 
has given the government an opportunity to move 
against its opponents—those innocent of any part

development of greatest significance in these last 
hard months has been the conversion of the con- 
servative privileged classes to the opposition. Thus it 
was not only the leaders of radical opinion in Argen- 
tina who were being sought for imprisonment by the 

lice but such leaders as the presidents of the Rural 
Society, the Stock Exchange, and the Industrial 
Union; former Foreign Ministers Carlos Saavedra 
Lamas and José Maria Cantilo; and the rectors of 
fve national universities. To the extent that this 
may signify the willingness of conservative elements 
in Argentine society to cooperate with the left in 
establishing a stable and progressive government, it 
is a fortunate circumstance for the post-Perdén era. 


FROM PASSIVE TO ARMED RESISTANCE? 
With the accession of the powerful Radical party to 
the democratic front, the ranks of the opposition are 
united. Yet there is little that can be done to bring 
about government reform through ordinary political 
channels owing to the reimposition of the state of 
siege prohibiting freedom of press and assembly, 
and to the restrictions placed on political parties by 
the Electoral Statute, announced on August 1, under 
which the state can control their organization. 
However, the calling of a combined general strike 
and lockout is contemplated, which would so 
completely paralyze the economic life of the nation 
that the military would have to hand over the gov- 
ermment to the Supreme Court. Under Argentine law 
that institution would then be required to call elec- 
tions within 90 days. Only the optimists in the op- 
position believe, however, that the government 
would tolerate a strike without resort to arms; and 
there are those, like the Argentine labor delegates to 
the World Trade Union Conference, who talk open- 
ly of armed rebellion as soon as the united demo- 
cratic forces can make concrete plans. Argentina’s 
conscript army, in the last analysis, holds the key to a 


| peaceful internal solution of the existing impasse. 
| The opposition may base its hopes for the successful 


outcome of the strike in the anticipated reluctance of

CHAPULTEPEC—POSSIBLE FORMULA. 
While the Argentine people must be the chief pro- 
tagonists in the events leading to a change in govern- 
ment, there are indications today that they would be 
less hostile to the idea of active intervention by the 
United Nations than was the case a few months ago 
when the situation did not look so dark. This sug- 
gests the advisability of re-examining inter-American 
policy toward Argentina in the light of the Farrell- 
Perén government’s omission to implement its obli- 
gations under the Act of Chapultepec, and involves 
deciding whether the actions of that government are 
of purely domestic significance or constitute a threat 
to hemisphere security. If this language has the ring 
of familiarity, it is because the problem has not to 
this date been confronted and dealt with effectively. 
The failure of the Mexico City policy to stamp out 
Axis influences in Argentina has been admitted, and 
a more realistic approach is promised by the fact that 
Assistant Secretary Braden returned from Buenos 
Aires convinced that there is an ‘‘extremely danger- 
ous” Nazi element which has been organized into a 
“vast Nazi-Fascist espionage network,” the existence 
of which is confirmed by official statements of the 
government itself. 


Mr. Braden has emphasized his view, based on 
first-hand acquaintance with the Argentine scene, 
that the people of that country are the best insurance 
against an extension of the underground Axis men- 
ace and should be given ample encouragement to 
settle the situation themselves. If, however, the pres- 
ent impasse should give way to civil war, the Act of 
Chapultepec offers a formula by which the American 
nations may act immediately to isolate Argentina 
from diplomatic and economic communication with 
the rest of the continent. On October 20 the Amer- 
ican Republics will convene at Rio de Janeiro to con- 
sider the question of drafting the Act of Chapultepec 
into permanent treaty form. Before that time it must 
be decided whether Argentina, as a signatory to the 
Act, shall attend a conference in which its own situa- 
tion will be in the foreground as the possible test 
case of a new regional security system. It is unlikely 
however, that the American nations will agree on 
the advisability of imposing sanctions on the recalci- 
trant member of the hemisphere union, if only be- 
cause of the practical economic considerations in- 
volved. A year ago, a similar attempt was abandoned, 
chiefly because of the urgent need of the United 
Nations for Argentine foodstuffs. Its wheat and beef 
shipments are no less vital today as Europe faces 
starvation. To find other ways of eliminating the 
very real danger to inter-American unity and peace

FRANCE PROHIBITS GOVERNMENT OPIUM 
MONOPOLIES IN INDO-CHINA 


The French Provisional Government informed the 
Acting Secretary General of the League of Nations 
on July 13, 1945, that it ‘confirms the principle of 
absolute prohibition of opium smoking in all terri- 
tories in the Far East under French authority. This 
declaration refers in the first place to Indo-China.” 

Thus, France joins with the Netherlands and Great 
Britain in ending an ancient evil which has caused 
friction for a hundred years between European pow- 
ers and China. The unequivocal declaration by Great 
Britain in the House of Commons, November 10, 
1943, “that His Majesty’s Government have now de- 
cided to adopt the policy of total prohibition of

AMERICANS ViEW PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH GREATER REALISM 


BN the eve of the peace conference opening in 
Paris on July 29 relations between the prin- 
cipal Allies of World War II have reached a stage 
of deterioration far more alarming for the future 
of the world than the atomic bomb; for the bomb 
is merely a symbol of the profound anxiety that 
grips peoples everywhere. The chief problem of the 
Paris negotiators is not how to make peace with 
the former enemies but how to keep it among the 
former victorious Allies. 


ALLIES STRUGGLE FOR GERMANY. Wher- 
ever one turns strife is rampant, and human beings 
who have not yet cleared away the rubble of war 
wearily face the threat of new conflicts. In China 
General Marshall’s efforts to bring about a recon- 
ciliation between the Central government and the 
Communists have proved fruitless, and civil war 
has flared up anew. In Germany the four powers 
which had undertaken to prevent the resurgence of 
German nationalism are fostering it by their dis- 
agreement about the political and economic future 
of the country which, even though defeated and 
partially destroyed, retains incalculable potential- 
ities to determine the destiny of Europe. Will the 
Germans turn to Russia, even more than they did at 
Rapallo in 1922, when the Soviet government was 
still weak and itself opposed by the Western world; 
and will the coalition of Germany's industrial skill 
and Russia’s manpower, dreamed of but not 
achieved by such diverse leaders as Bismarck, Rath- 
enau and Hitler, become a reality? If such a coali- 
tion is to be prevented, what can the United States 
and Britain offer to Germany, which before the war 
was their principal competitor for world markets 
and whose economic recovery beyond the point 
where it can pay for essential imports they can hardly 
welcome? Will Allied control of Germany develop 


into a sort of auction for German support, with the 
Western powers and Russia trying to outbid each 
other? Compared to this struggle for domination of 
Germany, the peace treaties with Italy and the Axis 
satellites in Eastern Europe which are to be con- 
sidered by the Paris Peace Conference dwindle to 
peripheral importance. 


Nor is it possible to argue that the Allied con- 
testants are animated solely by the desire to weaken 
or ultimately destroy each other. Other motives be- 
sides ambition for strategic power complicate the 
picture. The United States and Britain genuinely 
fear that Russia will use its control of Eastern Ger- 
many to impose on the entire country the practices 
made familiar by the Soviet system, and thus defeat 
democratization of the Germans. Yet they have not 
defined their own concept of a central administra- 
tion of Germany for which they have been pressing 
since last autumn, apparently assuming that central 
economic administrations for trade, finance, and so 
on can be established without the need for creating 
central political institutions. France, invaded by Ger- 
many three times in one generation, with equal sin- 
cerity opposes a centralized political framework 
for the Reich, fearing that it will again breed mili- 
tarism, and for reasons both of strategy and urgent 
economic need France demands the detachment of 
the Ruhr and administration of the area by an inter- 
national commission. Russia sounds disingenuous to 
its wartime Allies when, after having claimed Ger- 
man territories for itself and Poland, it now opposes 
further “dismemberment” of the Reich. But there 
is little doubt that its demand for additional repa- 
rations out of the current production of an econom- 
ically united Germany is due first of all to its own 
vast needs for reconstruction, which cannot be filled 
promptly either by Russia’s industrial facilities,

ia mass purchasing power that this country can be-

s. Yet if China were to prepare itself for par- 
ticipation in a future Soviet-American conflict, the 
Chinese government would hardly be interested in 
economic change, but would rather bend its efforts 
toward suppressing the progressive or radical ele- 
ments which advocate reform. (3) Again, few things 
could be more beneficial for China than to have the 
progressive elements, which undoubtedly exist in 
the Kuomintang, take over the leadership of the 

. Yet these are the very people who are least 
interested in developing China’s military potential- 
ities and who would most prefer to turn their atten- 
tion to the problems of peaceful reconstruction. To 
approach China largely in military terms would be 
to allow Russian political influence to spread by de- 
fault. It would be a confession that the United States, 
while anxious to make use of China, had little to 
offer the Chinese people politically. 

Since a policy of stressing China's military role 
in world affairs would offer encouragement to the 
most militaristic people in the central government, 
a large section of the Chinese people would almost 
certainly hold responsible any foreign power that: 
gave such encouragement, as Mme. Sun Yat-sen 
pointed out on July 23. Lest it be thought that there 
is anything partisan in this outlook, it is equally 
certain that if the United States were neutral in 
China, and Russia poured out military assistance 
to the Chinese Communists, most of the people 
would show great hostility toward Russian policy. 
The fundamental attitude of the Chinese people is 
quite simple: they are neither pro-Russian nor pro- 
American, they are only pro-Chinese. They know 
that a Soviet-American war might be fought first 
of all on their soil, and they have no desire to be- 
come a battleground for other powers. 


CAN CHINA SERVE AS MILITARY BASE? 
Apart from all these considerations, China at present 
offers a pitiful picture of a potential base. The gov- 
efnment is weak and commands only partial alle- 
giance from the people, it faces a strong political 


Page Three 


and military opponent in the Chinese Communists, 
its administrative structure creaks and is marked by 
far greater corruption than in more modern coun- 
tries, its economy is chaotic and suffers from a fan- 
tastic inflation, and its heterogenous troops are in 
various stages of training and development. China 
cannot become strong militarily unless it fortifies 
itself economically and politically, and this can be 
done only if military considerations are minimized 
and emphasis is placed on the creation of a modern 
coalition régime. The logical outcome of a military 
approach to China would be a policy of increasing 
American armed intervention, to make up for the 
power deficiencies of the Chinese government. Ac- 
tually, however, at latest reports, General Marshall's 


‘return to the United States is to be followed by 


the withdrawal of American marines. 


Only one policy can satisfy the real interests of 
China and the United States: to start from the 
premise that full-scale civil war must be stopped, 
that China needs an indefinite period of peace for 
reconstruction, that the main economic and political 
emphasis should be on welfare and democracy, that 
peace cannot be achieved except through the co- 
operation of all political groups and parties, and that 
the best way to attain peace in China is to avoid en- 
couraging the militarists and to make our support 
truly conditional on the establishment of democratic 
unity, in accordance with President Truman’s state- 
ment of last December 15. 


Since the Japanese surrender the United States 
has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into 
China in one form or another—lend-lease, our pre- 
dominant share of UNRRA aid, technical assistance, 
the cost of our armed forces, the extension of a 
cotton loan, etc.—but it appears to many Americans 
over here that much of this money has gone down 
the drain. Our assistance will begin to bring genuine 
returns only when China has a progressive coalition 
government, emphasizing reconstruction, not war.

EMPHASIS ON IMPORTS NEEDED TO BALANCE U.S. LOAN POLICY 


The economies of other nations are dependent 
on the United States as never before, for this is 
the only country which has adequate productive 
capacity and loan capital to assist in restoring their 
trade and industry; yet the current economic situa- 
tion here is such as to create grave uncertainty 
throughout the world. Price controls in the United 
States have been allowed to lapse owing to differ- 
ences over the provisions of a new OPA law. By 
the end of the week a compromise price control law 
will have been enacted, but whether the new measure 
will be effective in preventing an inflation spiral re- 


mains to be seen. Fear prevails abroad that the 
United States may experience an uncontrolled rise of 
prices followed by a sharp deflation. If this should 
occur, other nations feel reasonably certain that 
public opinion here will move toward increased pro- 
tectionism, as it did after World War I. 

BRITISH MAY AVOID USING LOAN. The 
most striking example of this uncertainty is the 
situation of the British loan, which was signed by 
President Truman on July 15. In return for the loan, 
Britain undertook to join this country in a program 
of freer multilateral trade, involving important 


-~ 


trade concessions by the British. When the agree- 
ment was drawn up last summer, London measured 
the real value of the loan in terms of prices then 
prevailing. In the meantime, however, American 
prices have gradually but steadily increased. Since 
the demise of OPA, the upward trend has accel- 
erated. It is not surprising, therefore, that on July 
19 the Financial Secretary to the British Treasury 
announced in Parliament that, although the dollar 
credits had been granted, Britain did not necessarily 
have to draw on them. He further implied that if 
inflation went unchecked here, London might not 
make much use of the loan. Given the precarious 
balance of payments position of Britain, it is a 
plausible assumption that if the loan is not fully 
used, that country will not remove its trade restraints, 
but instead will probably increase them. Whatever 
course Britain elects to follow will serve as an ex- 
ample to other countries which face similar balance 
of payments difficulties. In short, it is clear that the 
threat of inflation is a setback for the American pro- 
gram to promote freer world trade. Stated in another 
way observers abroad, remembering the interwar 
period, have come to think of the American econ- 
omy as being highly unstable; they fear another 
boom and bust, with dire effects on their already 
strained economic systems. 


NO LOANS TO RUSSIA AND CHINA NOW. 
The British loan has been regarded throughout as 
a special measure; loans to other countries must be 
made from the resources of the Export-Import Bank. 
But commitments already undertaken by the Bank 
have reduced its remaining lending power to about 
$350 million. This sum is obviously much less than 
the amounts Russia and China want to borrow. On 
July 18 the President announced he would not re- 
quest Congress to increase the lending power of 
the Bank during the present session; as a result, no 
credit commitments for Russia and China are to be 
made before 1947. Observers agree that Congres- 
sional sentiment at the present time is definitely 
averse to a grant of credit to Russia. In China, little

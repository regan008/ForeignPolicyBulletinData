Opposition to Japanese aggression on the continent 
is indicated by his desire to end the China war on 
the basis of China’s giving Japan six northern prov-

from Tojo, persons of his type cannot be expected 
to develop a new Japan. 

IS JAPAN READY FOR A CONSTITUTION? 
The new Diet is expected to give early considera- 
tion to a new draft constitution issued by the Shide- 
hara cabinet with General MacArthur's approval. 
This draft, which differs markedly from the old 
Japanese constitution, provides for a monarchy un- 
der an Emperor shorn of his governmental powers. 
It also renounces war for all time and pledges to 
Japanese citizens various rights, including—in addi- 
tion to the usual clauses concerning freedom of 
speech, press, assembly, etc.—guarantees of an equal 
education, academic freedom, collective bargaining 
for workers, the right to work, and freedom from 
“discrimination in political, economic or social re- 
lations because of race, creed, sex, social status, or 
family origin.” The Diet, consisting of two elective 
bodies—a House of Representatives and a House 
of Councilors—is to be “the sole law-making au- 
thority,” and the cabinet is to be responsible to the 
Diet. 

While many features of the constitution are im- 
pressive, it is difficult to see why it is necessary to 
adopt a definitive governmental charter at this time. 
Generally speaking, if a democratic constitution is 
to be lasting, it should proceed from a considerable 
body of popular experience and should give legal 
expression to achievements already registered in 
what promises to be enduring form. The United 
States constitution, for example, undoubtedly owes 


NEW PLAN FOR GERMAN ECONOMY HINGES ON CENTRALIZED CONTROL 


In accordance with the Potsdam Protocol of last 
July, the Allied Control Council has submitted a 
plan determining the amount and character of in- 
dustrial equipment not required for the German 
peace economy and therefore available for repara- 
tions. This plan, which was submitted on March 28, 
would reduce the level of industry as a whole to 
about 50 to 55 per cent of the 1938 prewar level, 
excluding building and building materials indus- 
tries. The guiding principles for reparations and the 
level of German postwar economy were given in the 
Potsdam Protocol; in applying these principles, how- 
ever, differences developed in the Council with the 
result that the plan contains compromises. But these 
compromises were such as to make the plan coin- 
cide ally with the United States’ point of view, 
which favored a greater reduction in steel capacity 
than the British wanted, but less than that desired 
by Russia.

much of its success to the fact that it was the produg 
of many years experience in the art of self-goverp, 
ment in the colonial legislatures. By comparison, the 
seven months of Japanese development under th 
occupation appear too short to justify constitution, 
action. It would seem best simply to junk the old 
constitution and to establish on a tentative basis 
such new administrative forms as are necessary fo, 
the functioning of the governmental machinery, 


It is quite proper, for example, for General Head. 
quarters, through its day-to-day directives, to deny 
the Japanese the power to wage war, or to insist op 
the extension of freedom in Japan. But to pretend 
that a constitution renouncing war or guaranteeing 
academic freedom represents the dominant outlook 
of the country today is to encourage complaceng 
in the United States about the state of affairs in 
Japan. Moreover, adoption of the draft constitution 
would place an unnecessary stamp of approval on 
the institution of the Emperor, thereby prejudicing 
the future establishment of a Japanese republic, 


should the Japanese ultimately wish such a govern 
ment. 


Recent developments therefore emphasize the im- 
portance of keeping the Japanese political situation 
fluid and not committing ourselves to groups or poli- 
cies that would act as a brake on further moves to- 


ward democracy. We are dealing in Japan not with ) 


free allies, but with a people who are still in the 
shadow of militarism, despite the progress they 
have been making. In such a situation we should 
not shirk our responsibility by imagining that the 
position we occupy is one of neutrality rather than 
active intervention. 


LAWRENCE K. ROSINGER 


Protocol envisaged for Germany a “production and 
maintenance of goods and services required to meet 
the needs of the occupying forces and displaced 
persons in Germany and essential to maintain in 
Germany average living standards not exceeding the 
average of standards of living of European coun 
tries.” The reductions specified in the plan have 
this objective; and they are intended simultaneously 
to destroy German war potential and to make Ger- 
many self-supporting. The amount of capital equip- 
ment available for reparations is therefore deter- 
mined indirectly. The plan bans entirely some in- 
dustries, including armaments, as well as fourteen 
specific industries which were an integral part of 
the war economy, as for example, synthetic gaso- 
line, oil, rubber, and ball and roller bearings. A 
second group of industries is to be reduced dras 
tically. Included in this group is steel, vital in both 
war and peace. Steel capacity is set at 7,500,000 








ingot tons, which may be further reduced; but ac 








it ac

tual steel production shall not exceed 5,800,000 
ingot tons. Tonnages for nonferrous metals have 
also been scaled down, and maximum annual out- 

ts fixed. Similarly, basic chemicals, pharmaceuti- 
cals, dyestuffs, and synthetic fibers are greatly re- 
duced, as are machine tools and light and heavy en- 
gineering trades. A third group comprises those 
industries which will be retained, and some of which 
will contribute to maximizing agriculture, as for 
example, agricultural machinery. Moreover, since 
Germany cannot become a closed economy, exports 
will be necessary. Accordingly, optics and precision 
instruments, coal, potash, and certain other light 
consumer-goods industries are to become the main- 
stay of the new economy, and provide exports. Ap- 
proved imports planned for 1949 are to be 3 billion 
marks, the same as exports. Payments for imports 
of food and fodder will be a first charge on the pro- 
ceeds of exports, and are not to exceed 1.5 billion 
marks. The remaining 1.5 billion marks will cover 
costs of raw materials, transport, insurance and oc- 
cupation expenses. 

US. POLICY ON REPARATIONS. United 
States policy on reparations has, among other things, 
provided that German war potential be eliminated 
and that capital goods removed from Germany be 
distributed among the non-enemy nations of Europe 
in a manner to hasten the restoration and raising 
of their standards of living. Moreover, having in 
mind the fiasco of World War I reparations, our 
policy has been averse to any proposals which would 
require long-term reparations, with German pro- 
ductive capacity to meet them and, as after the last 
wat, United States funds. By the same token, a plan 
which leaves the Germans insufficient resources to 
maintain themselves would be unacceptable to us 
for the obvious reason, again, that we would not 
want to make good their food shortages for a long 
period. Nor would we desire the German standard 
of living so lowered as to cause famine, pestilence 
and disorder. Agreements covering these points 
were incorporated in the Potsdam Protocol, and 
governed the work of the Council in drafting its 
plan. The Protocol made no provision for long-term 
feparations, the amount of which would in any 
event be directly affected by later decisions on plant 
removals. Given the drastic removals contemplated 
in the Control Council plan, it is not likely that any 
fecurrent reparations will be possible. 

CAN GERMANY BE MADE SELF-SUPPORT- 
ING? The United States, Britain and, to a lesser 
extent, France are now furnishing Germany food,

seeds and various other supplies. An important 
question, therefore, is whether the new plan will 
enable Germany to pay its way. Admittedly, certain 
of the assumptions underlying the plan are de- 
batable, in particular the expectation that Germany 
will become a single economic unit, in accordance 
with the Potsdam Protocol. Economic unification 
is vital to the success of the plan; for if Germany is 
not so treated, the lack of coordination between 
the zones, with their diverse resources, will frustrate 
any efforts to compel the Germans to sustain them- 
selves. The March report by the American Military 
Government states that economic conditions in our 
zone have deteriorated steadily “for want of imple- 
mentation of the common policy and economic co- 
ordination for the whole of Germany.” To date, 
central administrative agencies have not been set 
up. Furthermore, agreement has not been reached 
on the Ruhr and the Rhineland. 

THE REACTION IN LONDON. Reports from 
London indicate growing dissatisfaction in official 
British circles with the Potsdam agreement, and 
the idea is being unofficially broached that at the 
coming meeting of the Foreign Ministers the en- 
tire German problem be reviewed, or a date set for 
a new conference to recast the agreement. Absence 
of central control would continue to accentuate the 
difficulties of economic administration in the west- 
ern zone, and would in fact make impossible any plan 
whereby the Germans are to be self-sustaining. In 
any event, economic demobilization of Germany 
will cost us something; we should strive for policies 
which will moderate these costs. From a strictly 
political point of view, however, it may be desir- 
able to subsidize the new German economy. Mean- 
while, we are attempting to democratize the Ger- 
mans on 1,200 calories a day, while in the Russian 
zone, where agricultural resources are greater, the 


ration is 1,600. Haro_p H. HUTCHESON

DIPLOMATIC REVERSES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT U.S. POLICY 


Efforts made by the United States in recent months 
to influence affairs in various countries, notably Ar- 
gentina, Spain, Iran and Yugoslavia, have failed. 
The unsatisfactory consequences of our interventions 
call for a change in the conduct of our foreign 
policy. While United States foreign policy is based 
on the recognition that we have world-wide respon- 
sibilities in maintaining the peace, we have not yet 
hit on the diplomatic technique that will best guide 
us toward this goal. 

POLICY TOWARD ARGENTINA. Our short- 
comings in the conduct of foreign policy are appar- 
ent in our relations with Argentina. On February 11 
the State Department published a Blue Book which 
accused that government of having aided Germany 
during World War II, and of failing to carry out 
treaty pledges made at Rio de Janeiro in 1942 and 
at Mexico City in 1945 to repress German influences 
in Argentina. The publication date suggested strong- 
ly that the United States hoped to deter Argentines 
from voting in the presidential election of Febru- 
ary 24 for Colonel Juan Perén, the power behind the 
Farrell government. 

On March 28 Perén’s victory was assured. He 
won by 1,478,028 votes to 1,210,665 for his op- 
ponent, Tamborini. That victory was not in itself a 
complete rebuff to the United States, which in- 
tended to require that Perén rid himself of the Nazi 
influences described in the Blue Book before we 
would sign a treaty providing for mutual defense of 
the hemisphere to which Argentina would also be 
signatory. The other American Republics, how- 
ever, overwhelmingly indicated their willingness to 
sign such a treaty with the new, legally constituted 
Argentine government. Unless the United States 
was to become isolated in inter-American affairs, a 
fundamental review of its Argentine policy seemed 
necessary. 

In recognition of Perén’s victory, the United 
States on April 2 informed the Argentine govern- 
ment that it had appointed George S. Messersmith 
Ambassador to Argentina, to fill the post left pur- 
posely vacant since last August when Spruille 
Braden was named Assistant Secretary of State. Lest 
Argentina consider this nomination a complete 
abandonment of the policy which led us to publish 
the Blue Book, the State Department on April 8 
indicated that it would sign a hemisphere treaty 
with Perén provided he carries out existing treaty 
pledges to eliminate Axis influences. This condi- 
tional announcement was aimed primarily at Lud- 
wig Freude, Perén’s intimate adviser, whom the 


_ Saas - —_- saedshlnteth.gthioath cee niece ane 


Blue Book described as leader of the Nazi German 
colony in Buenos Aires. But President Truman’s ad. 
dress to the Pan American Union on April 15, call. 
ing for inter-American solidarity against the threat 
of atomic warfare, was interpreted by Latin Ameri. 
cans as further evidence that the United States was 
modifying its Argentine policy. 

OTHER REBUFFS. Developments in other quar- 
ters also disclose the United States’ inability to 
achieve its immediate aims in international rela. 
tions. On March 4 the State Department issued q 
set of documents captured in Germany which de. 
picted General Franco as an active Axis collaborator 
who had given Germany and Italy military help 
during World War II. At the same time the United 
States, France and the United Kingdom called on 
the Spanish people to oust Franco by peaceful 
means. Yet Franco still controls Spain, while in the 
central Mediterranean area United States interfer. 
ence has also been rebuffed. On April 2 the United 
States, in an unusual judicial intervention, requested 
Yugoslavia to permit U.S. soldiers to testify on be 
half of General Draja Mikhailovitch, whom the 
Yugoslav government has accused of collaborating 
with the enemy. On April 5 this request was refused. 

On March 25 Secretary of State Byrnes told the 
United Nations Security Council that this country 
supported the right of Iran to accuse Russia of in- 
terfering in Iranian affairs in a manner that threat. 
ened world peace. While on April 4 the United 
States and other members of the Council accepted 
Russia's assurances that it would withdraw its troops 
—the chief instrument of intervention—from Iran 
by May 6, Russia nevertheless solidified its eco 
nomic and political relationship with Iran a day 
later by obtaining a tentative promise of an oil con 
cession and by freezing, for practical purposes, the 
autonomy of Azerbaijan. Thus Russian interference 
in Iran continues on a firm basis despite our desire 
to terminate it. 

To strengthen our diplomacy in the Wester 
Hemisphere, many Senators suggest that the United 
States act only through established channels for 
inter-American cooperation and abide by the wishes 
of the majority. Perhaps our world-wide diploma 
would gain if we resorted to the United Nations 
whenever we feel it desirable to intervene in at 
other’s affairs and would seek, in our representa 
tions to the United Nations, to get at the roots of 
problems abroad rather than deal with surface 
manifestations.

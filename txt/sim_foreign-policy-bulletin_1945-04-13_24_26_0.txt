APRIL 13, 1945 


HE blows now raining on Japan from many di- 
rections are portents of ultimate disintegration, 
imilar to that facing the Nazis in the West. In re- 
eat weeks American forces have made significant 
avances on Okinawa, the British Navy has stepped 
w its Far Eastern operations, Moscow has deprived 
pan of the consolation of the Soviet-Japanese neu- 
tality pact, the Koiso régime has fallen and given 
wy to the Suzuki cabinet, American planes have 
wok the 45,000-ton battleship Yamato, and General 
MacArthur and Admiral Nimitz have been placed 
ncommand, respectively, of all American Army and 
Navy forces in the Pacific. This chain of unbroken 
jpanese misfortunes is a symbol of Japan’s decline 
sa military power and of greater defeats ahead. 
END OF A TREATY. Of all these events, Soviet 
denunciation of the neutrality pact with Japan means 
most to the American public, for this country has 
ong looked toward the time when our Russian allies 
would be able to show their solidarity with us in 
he East. Now Moscow has served notice on Tokyo 
hat the pact “‘has lost its sense’’ and its prolongation 
s‘impossible.”” The grounds given by the Russians— 
hat Japan has aided Germany against the U.S.S.R. 
ind has waged war with the latter’s allies, the United 
Mates and Britain—clearly could be used to justify 
Wviet entrance into the Far Eastern conflict without 
vaiting for the expiration of the treaty in April 1946. 
Yet the American public should not expect the 
viet Union to fight Japan at an early date, unless 
Tokyo undertakes the desperate, fatal gamble of 
itiking first. It is true that the end of the European 
vat is in sight, but it is not yet here. Moreover, after 
karing the main brunt of Nazi might and losing 
millions of men in the process, the Russians may be 
mpected, at least, to wait until the main body of 
Tokyo’s armies has been tied down by the forces of 
le other United Nations. It is also possible that

IS OUR CHINA POLICY CONSISTENT WITH NEEDS OF PACIFIC WAR? 


Moscow will concentrate on various important meas- 
ures short of war, for example, making bases avail- 
able to the United States. 

The likelihood that the U.S.S.R. will aid us against 
Japan in no way lessens our own military responsibil- 
ities. In fact, it has now become more urgent for us 
to help create the conditions under which the Rus- 
sians can participate at the earliest moment. It must 
at the same time be recognized that denunciation of 
the neutrality pact has valuable immediate effects. It 
establishes a more favorable atmosphere for the San 
Francisco Conference, obliges Japan to maintain or 
even increase its forces in Manchuria and Korea, 
and undoubtedly has greatly heightened the tension 
and gloom already existing in Tokyo. 

FUTURE OF MANCHURIA. Yet questions have 
been raised about Moscow’s intentions in Manchuria, 
whose return to China was pledged by the United 
States and Britain at the Cairo Conference in No- 
vember 1943. There is no evidence that the U.S.S.R. 
desires to annex Manchuria or that it does not wish 
to see that territory become part of a friendly, stable 
China. But that the Russians will exert an important 
influence on the future of Manchuria, in which they 
have a deep security interest, is no more open to 
question than that America will help to shape the 
future of neighboring countries or of areas in which 
we have troops. 

A glance at the situation in China will show Man- 
churia’s explosive potentialities. At the present mo- 
ment the only Chinese resistance forces in or near 
the area are those of the Communist-led Eighteenth 
Group Army. If the Russians should later fight on 
Manchurian soil or in north China, they would come 
in contact with these troops and cooperate with them 
against Japan. The effect would be to strengthen the 
Eighteenth Group Army militarily and politically. 
If, before this happened, Chungking and the Com- 


8 ___________ 9 9775 | 


munists had reached an agreement on unity, the 
Russians would simply be in the position of render- 
ing aid to the local forces of a united China. But if 
an adjustment of Chinese internal differences had not 
been achieved, grave issues could be raised both for 
Chungking and Washington. 

OUR POLICY TOWARD CHINA. The Amer- 
ican public does not know whether the U.S.S.R. will 
use troops against Japan, but such aid would un- 
doubtedly be welcomed both on Main Street and in 
Washington. Clearly, to expect the Russians to fight 
ge without influencing the areas they enter is to 

of Moscow something that we do not ask of our- 
selves—something that is in any event a political im- 
=. For, even if the Russians do not enter 
anchuria, their voice will still be heard in that 
region. Consequently, the only practical approach 
for the United States is to accept the influence of the 
U.S.S.R. in northeast Asia as a fact and to seek to 
anticipate concrete problems, so that they may be 
prevented from arising or may be adjusted satisfac- 
torily when they appear. 

Under General Stilwell and our former Ambassa- 
dor to China, Clarence E. Gauss, it was American 
policy to exert strong pressure on Chungking for 
internal Chinese unity, and to establish direct contact 
with the Chinese guerrilla armies while cooperating 
to the full with the government and armed forces of 
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. This approach rest- 
ed on the conviction that it would be of great mili- 


NEED FOR UNDERSTANDING OF RUSSIA’S SECURITY PROGRAM 


Russia's denunciation of its neutrality pact with 
Japan has caused renewed discussion of Moscow’s 
foreign policy among those who, since Yalta, had 
expressed growing doubts about the willingness of 
the U.S.S.R. to cooperate with the Western powers. 
For many Americans Russia’s eventual participation 
in the Pacific war has become a primary test of its 
good faith. Yet no sooner does Moscow take a 
step in that direction than voices are heard de- 
claring that the U.S.S.R. has designs on areas of Asia 
adjacent to its borders. 

RUSSIA’S COURSE CLOSELY WATCHED. 
Whatever Russia does or fails to do, its actions or 
lack of them are suspect to other countries. When 
the Red Army was racing toward Berlin, many 
Americans were worried that the Russians would get 
dangerously ahead of their Western allies. Now that 
the Russian forces are concentrating on the occupa- 
tion of Vienna, the same people wonder why the 
Red Army has slowed down its drive toward Berlin. 
Suspicions are always voiced about the motives of 
great powers. The French, for example, have shown 
unmistakable anxiety concerning the ultimate objec- 
tives of the United States in Africa and Asia, where 
France has colonial interests.

tary value to help the Chinese guerrillas step up thei 
war effort, especially since we would be workin 
with them if we landed at certain points on the Ching 
coast. It was also felt that amicable American-Sovie 
and American-Chinese relations required that greate; 
Chinese unity be achieved before the final phases of 
the Far Eastern war. 

Recently a different tendency has found expression 
in some sectors of American policy toward China. 
For example, in an interview of April 2 in Washing. 
ton, Ambassador Patrick J. Hurley declared that the 
United States would confine its assistance entirely to 
Chungking and give no supplies to the Chinese Com. 
munists. If such a policy were actually carried out 
it would mean that we had decided, for political 
reasons, to forego the important military aid the 
guerrilla armies can furnish. It would also be incon. 
sistent with our interest in having the Russians fight 
the Japanese, since we would be in the position of 
encouraging the Russians to come in contact with the 
guerrillas whom we refused to aid. 

That such a tendency can long survive is open to 
doubt. The Gauss-Stilwell policy, despite the ob 
stacles it came up against, was a more realistic ap. 
proach to China’s problems. It was a policy that prom- 
ised—in so far as control of events lay in our power 
—to make maximum use of all Chinese armed forces 
in the war against Japan, and to lay a sound basis for 
cooperation with both China and Russia in war and 


peace. LAWRENCE K. ROSINGER 


But there are special reasons for the recurring 
anxiety about Russia's objectives in Europe. The fact 
that the U.S.S.R. is ruled by a political dictatorship 
dominated by the Communist party, which has not 
hesitated to repress by force opposition elements both 
within its borders and within those of countries it 
has helped to liberate from German rule; the exis- 
tence in Russia of a social and economic system that | 
challenges the system of private enterprise familiar 
to advanced Western countries; the absence of civil 
liberties associated with Western democracy; the 
hostile attitude of the Soviet government, until re- 
cently, toward organized religion, and its continuing | 
strictures on the policy of the Vatican—all these fac- , 
tors have influenced the judgment of other countries 
about Russia’s foreign policy. None of these factors 
can be disregarded. The primary question since Rus- 
sia’s invasion by Germany in 1941, however, has 
been not whether Russia would adopt the political 
and economic institutions of Britain and the United | 
States, but whether it would continue to fight the 
Germans and, once a common victory had been 
achieved, would participate in the establishment of 
an effective international organization that could pre- 
vent another global war in the future. This question

has lost none of its urgency. Can it be answered with 
any degree of assurance on the eve of the San Fran- 
cisco Conference? 

SECURITY MOSCOW’S CHIEF AIM. What can 
be said is that the U.S.S.R. is just as determined to 
achieve security as the United States or any other 
country. It has suffered enormous losses in man- 

wer and material resources, far in excess of the 
United States and, relatively speaking, of Britain. 
It intends to repair these losses as swiftly as possible, 
and to prevent their recurrence by all means at its 
disposal. Among these means is participation in a 
strong international organization. 

The Soviet government, when it accepted the 
Dumbarton Oaks proposals, apparently assumed that 
these proposals would be accepted by other nations 
without fundamental changes. Public discussion of 
controversial political questions is not as yet prac- 
tical in the U.S.S.R. It requires a major adjustment 
on the part of the Soviet government to lend itself 
to such discussion on the life-and-death matter of 
Russia's post-war security. Yet the more the Russians 
participate in international conferences, the more 
they become aware of the views of peoples outside 
their borders, the better is the prospect for ultimately 
finding a common ground for cooperation between 
the U.S.S.R. and the other United Nations. 

An international security organization, however,

will not of itself answer many questions which Rus- 
sia, like other nations, is asking about the future. 
Russia wants access to seaways and world markets; 
it wants stability in countries along its western bor- 
der; above all, it wants to make Germany incapable 
of embarking on another war of aggression, by de- 
priving the Germans of military power, and diverting 
their resources of labor and technical skill to the 
reconstruction of its devastated areas. This is what 
might be called Russia’s minimum program. At the 
same time, its military leaders, fresh from spectacular 
victories on the battlefield, want as much strategic 
protection for Russia on the west as it will be po- 
litically feasible to achieve; and nationalists in the 
Soviet government are in sympathy with this aim. 
Geographic proximity, military power, and similar- 
ities of economic and social problems, have already 
given Russia great influence in countries of Eastern 
Europe and the Balkans. This influence will spread 
westward only if the United States and Britain fail 
to assume their share of political responsibility in 
Europe, falter in their announced determination to 
establish an effective international organization, and 
find it impossible to agree with Russia about the 
treatment of Germany.

Washington News Letter 


COLONIAL ISSUE RAISED ON EVE OF SAN FRANCISCO CONFERENCE 


The dependent peoples of the world have a direct 
stake in the United Nations conference which opens 
on April 25 at San Francisco. The meeting is ex- 
pected to create machinery for the transfer of World 
War I mandates from the League of Nations to the 
new world organization, and the United States may 
propose, or at least support, an amendment to the 
Dumbarton Oaks proposals that would directly au- 
thorize the General Assembly to consider problems 
relating to colonial areas other than mandates. Dis- 
cussion about any particular region, like Palestine in 
reference to mandates or Indo-China in reference to 
colonies, would violate the purpose of the Confer- 
ence which has been convoked to establish the ma- 
chinery to deal with problems affecting world affairs. 
Disposition of Italian and Japanese colonies will 
await conclusion of the war, although the San Fran- 
cisco Conference may assign to the United States ad- 
ministrative control over the Pacific islands for which 
Japan was granted the mandate after World War I. 
Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander-in-Chief of the 
United States Fleet, on April 5 urged that this coun- 
try retain the Pacific Islands liberated by our forces. 

MANDATE QUESTIONS POSTPONED AT 
DUMBARTON OAKS. Had representatives of the 
United States, Britain, the Soviet Union and China 
completed the task they originally set for themselves 
in the Dumbarton Oaks conversations which ended 
October 7, 1944, they would have included in their 
proposals not 12 but 13 chapters. The 13th chapter 
was to have dealt with arrangements for transferring 
mandates, but the many weeks devoted to reaching 
agreement on proposals in the first 12 chapters dis- 
couraged the negotiators from prolonging the talks 
by consideration of this matter. Subsequently, hope 
developed that a special meeting on mandates might 
be held before April 25, but that prospect has faded. 
As a result, the San Francisco Conference will be 
asked to deal with this question, which President 
Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill and Marshal 
Stalin considered during their talks at Yalta. 

The San Francisco resolution on mandates can be 
expected to substitute for “mandate” some word 
like “‘trusteeship,”’ and to provide a more authorita- 
tive system of international supervision of trustee- 
ships than that provided in Article 29 of the League 
Covenant. The League Mandates Commission was 
unable to combat directly either the discriminatory 
tax imposed in Southwest Africa in 1922 by the 


FOR VICTORY ° 


Union of South Africa Administrator or the closed. 
door policy invoked by Japan for its mandates in the 
Pacific; also, it was forced to rely on reports from the 
maadatory governments for information respecting 
affairs in the mandates, 

The new international organization may assume a 
responsibility which the League of Nations never 
had, that of devising a formula by which all colonial 
areas could, like the mandates, be led gradually 
toward independence. The general authority of the 
Assembly, as set forth in the Dumbarton Oaks pro- 
posals, which grants to it “the right . . . to discuss 
any questions relating to the maintenance of inter- 
national peace and security brought before it by any 
member or members of the Organization,” covers 
colonial matters, but this government is said to con- 
sider it desirable that the Assembly be given a specific 
directive to discuss the colonial question. 

LOT OF COLONIALS IMPROVED. In antici- 
pation of a move for liberation of colonial posses- 
sions, the great powers have in recent years acceler- 
ated their programs for improving the social and 
political status of the dependent peoples. The British 
government has recently extended its Colonial De- 
velopment and Welfare Act, first passed in 1940, and 
the Dutch announced in 1943 that overseas posses- 
sions would receive after the war a fuller autonomy 
than the Act of 1925 gave them. The French govern- 
ment on January 19, 1945 announced that after the 
war Indo-China, most important of the French col- 
onies, would be autonomous. 

The colonial powers, however, do not seem will- 
ing to go beyond granting dependent areas a larger 
measure of self-government. In all that concerns 
colonial policy, the struggle will be between the 
forces that favor true national freedom under inter- 
national supervision and the forces that advocate 
nurturing colonial peoples for the status which we in 
the United States might describe as statehood. “It is 
imperative that the constitution which will determine 
the Jaws of the Fourth Republic must integrate our 
colonies into France,” said René Pleven, then French 
Colonial Minister, on October 29, 1944. Colonel 
Oliver Stanley, British Colonial Secretary, stated 
in his address to the Foreign Policy Association on 
January 19, 1945 that the aim of Britain’s colonial 
policy was the “achievement of the fullest possible 
measure of self-government within the Empire.”

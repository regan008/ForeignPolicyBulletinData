The stubborn resistance to the Rebel advance of- 
fered by the Basques and Asturians prolonged the 
northern campaign. Now winter threatens to handi- 
cap offensive operations in various parts of the 
peninsula. Both Loyalists and Rebels are reported 
preparing major drives, but it is possible that these 
may not be launched before spring. Pressure from 
Italy and Germany for a speedy victory, however, 
may force Franco to attempt a new advance in the 
near future. 

Any new offensive by the Rebels will encounter 
far stiffer opposition than that offered in the north.

Mussolini among them—as well as approximately Equipment has notably improved, although Franco 

















= Page Two 


still holds the apparent advantage in airplanes, ar- 
tillery and possibly tanks. Moreover, he has com- 
mand of the sea and is potentially in position to shut 
off the flow of supplies to his opponents. On Oc- 
tober 28 he announced a blockade of the entire 650 
miles of eastern and southern coastline left to the 
Loyalists. 

Behind the lines, both sides have attempted with- 
in recent months to develop political unity, which 
had been menaced by the pull and haul of partisan 
rivalries. On October 21 the Salamanca government 
announced the establishment of a Fascist National 
Council, in which the Carlist monarchists and the 
fascist Phalanx were represented together with mili- 
tary leaders. Reports of friction marring the rela- 
tions of Spanish, Italian and German troops con- 
tinue in circulation. In this connection, it may be 
significant that, while the rdle of Italian soldiers 
in the fall of Santander was widely publicized, 
Spanish troops alone were reported to have effected 
the capture of Gijén. 

On the other hand, friction among the Loyalists 
has been more open and perhaps more acute. A 
factor of major importance has been the increasing 
strength of the Communists, whose numbers are re- 
ported to have grown from approximately 50,000 
at the outbreak of the revolt to some 400,000 today. 
The Communist party has skillfully exploited a pol- 
icy of moderation toward socialization of industry 
and agriculture to win the support of numerous 
small farmers and business men. The growth of the 
Communist party has coincided with a decline in 
influence of the groups demanding drastic social 
revolution—the anti-Stalinist POUM, the Anarcho- 
Syndicalists and the left-wing Socialists, led by for- 
mer Premier Largo Caballero. When the Cortes 
convened at Valencia on October 1, the majority of 
Socialist deputies aligned themselves with the Com- 
munists and Left-Republicans to support the win- 
the-war policies of the Negrin cabinet. The possi- 
bility that middle-of-the-road elements might drift 
to Valencia rather than Salamanca was suggested 
on that occasion when Miguel Maura and Manuel 
Portela Valladares, prominent leaders of two Cen- 
ter parties, resumed their seats in the Cortes. 

The transfer of the Loyalist capital from Valencia 
to Barcelona, officially consummated on October 30, 
has been interpreted variously as a confession of 
weakness and a promise of greater strength and co- 
hesion. Barcelona is less open to attack than Valen- 
cia, either from the Teruel salient by land or from 
the Balearics by sea. On the other hand, it is un- 
doubtedly hoped that this step will bring Catalonia’s 
industry as well as man power more actively into 
the conflict. The move exemplifies the intensive 
mobilization of all available resources now being 
carried out by both of Spain’s warring factions.

VAN ZEELAND RESIGNS 


The “Belgian New Deal” of Paul Van Zeeland 
came abruptly to an end early last week, when the 
Prime Minister and his cabinet resigned amidst 
charges of corruption in connection with the Na. 
tional Bank. As Van Zeeland retired to private life 
seeking to clear his reputation and restore his fail. 
ing health, King Leopold on October 31 invited 
Hubert Pierlot, Catholic Minister of Agriculture, to 
form a new cabinet. 

Dr. Van Zeeland, a non-party economist, had 0 
ganized a coalition cabinet in 1934, based on the 
cooperation of the three major democratic parties 
Catholic, Liberal, and Socialist—in an effort to com. 
bat the depression and to head off the Rexist, ot 
Fascist, party of Léon Degrelle. Pursuing a moder. 
ate course and appealing for national unity, the 
Premier was able to restore confidence and to pro 
mote recovery, especially through devaluation of the 
belga in September 1936. The prospects of the 
Rexists were further diminished last April, when 
Van Zeeland overwhelmingly defeated Degrelle in 
a Brussels electoral contest.* As the emergeng 
which had created the coalition government gradu: 
ally passed, however, internal friction reappeared 
among the constituent elements. The several groups 
manoeuvred toward obtaining future power, and 
a few members of the cabinet, including the Social: 
ist Minister of Finance, Henri de Man, apparently 
became involved in an intrigue against the Prime 
Minister. 


The fall of the cabinet was precipitated by charge 
of financial corruption long hurled by the Rexist 
against bankers and more recently made by Gustavu 
Sap, a Flemish leader and former Finance Minister. 
It was charged that Van Zeeland frequently received 
large sums from the National Bank, of which he had 
previously been Vice Governor. A special sessioa 
of Parliament, summoned on September 7 by the 
Prime Minister, promptly cleared him of any im 
proper conduct. Dr. Van Zeeland proved that of 
leaving the Bank he had merely accepted his jus 


share of a common fund provided for the directors | 


The government decided, however, to abolish thi 

“pool” and to reduce the salaries of the bank oft 

cials, several of whom were receiving over five tim 

as much as the Premier. Public suspicion regardin 

the National Bank was accentuated by the Van

Washington News Letter 


as 

















WASHINGTON BUREAU 
National Press Building 


Nov. 1—On the eve of the Brussels conference, 
Washington officials are somewhat concerned by the 
“brutal logic’ of those commentators who have 
condemned the Nine Power meeting to utter and 
complete futility. No one denies that Japan’s curt 
refusal to attend the conference has put a serious 
crimp in the program of “peaceful settlement.” But 
State Department officials are represented as feeling 
that there is still a middle ground between the dras- 
tic alternatives of punitive action to stop Japan and 
complete acquiescence in the breakdown of all in- 
rernational morality. At any rate, the effort will be 
made to find a basis for restoring peace without 
resort to force and without sacrificing the integrity 
of China. The question is how this can be accom- 
plished without another Hoare-Laval deal, which is 
officially frowned upon in both Washington and 
London. 

The prospects of constructive action are admit- 
tedly slim, however. While Japan might conceiv- 
ably be willing to accept an armistice, its terms 
would certainly include the military occupation of 
all territory now in Japanese hands in the north, and 
the retirement of Chinese troops from the Shanghai 
area—which China could not possibly accept. On 
the other hand, while China might welcome a truce 
based on the restoration of the status guo ante, these 
terms would hardly be acceptable to Japan. There 
is no real answer to this dilemma in Washington. 
The best proposal advanced is a vague suggestion 
that methods of procedure will be found to keep the 
door Open to negotiation as long as possible. This 
the form of a small subcommittee, com- 
posed of Britain, France and the United States, for 
the purpose of approaching Japan and China. 


MacArthur’s retirement. Although it passed 
almost unnoticed in the American press, the prema- 
ture retirement of General Douglas MacArthur, 
military adviser to President Quezon and Field 
Marshal of the Philippine Army, represents the end 
of a long struggle waged under cover in Washing- 


may 


| ton since the inauguration of the Philippine Com- 


monwealth. Certain officials of liberal bent, who 
are striving to make Philippine independence a real- 
ity rather than a mere form, have from the first op- 
posed the MacArthur mission. To them it is a symbol 
of American tutelage in the upbuilding of a Philip- 
pine defense system. Critics have emphasized the 
anomaly of having an American army officer in 


active service at the head of the military forces of 
a country preparing for self-government. They have 
never ceased to suspect that Filipinos were being 
conscripted and taught to bear arms to further 
American as well as Philippine aspirations in the 
Western Pacific. 

The retirement of MacArthur, the moving spirit 
behind this development, marks a victory for his op- 
ponents. It does not necessarily mean that militariza- 
tion of the Philippines under the “MacArthur plan” 
will be retarded. Whether or not his aides remain 
in the Islands, American officers and troops will be 
stationed there until 1946. The link with the War 
Department will be strengthened by Quezon’s se- 
lection of General Creed F. Cox, retired chief of 
its Bureau of Insular Affairs, as his personal adviser 
in Manila. Nevertheless, a top-rank American of- 
ficer, reported to favor a strong anti-Japanese policy, 
will no longer remain in command of the Philip- 
pine Army. 

Czech and British trade agreement negotiations 
advanced. Secretary Hull’s trade agreement machine 
continues to move steadily along its well-charted 
and unspectacular course. Last week the process of 
making an agreement with Czechoslovakia reached 
the stage of public hearings by the Committee for 
Reciprocity Information, under the new procedure 
introduced early this year. Domestic shoe manu- 
facturers, aroused by the inclusion of their product 
in the list of commodities on which tariff reductions 
may be considered, descended on Washington in 
force to present a vigorous case against any conces- 
sions to their Czech competitors. Although the Com- 
mittee tries to restrict the hearings to the presenta- 
tion of facts, interests which want protection have 
quite naturally succeeded in using them as a sound- 
ing-board for their views. Exporters and consumers 
who would benefit by tariff reductions have unfor- 
tunately contented themselves in the main with un- 
publicized written briefs. But the preponderance of 
adverse publicity is no new story in trade agreement 
negotiations, and officials therefore see no unusual 
difficulties in the way of the Czech agreement. 

Their most pressing need at the moment is an 
anodyne to assuage the bitter opposition of many 
American farmers to a program they erroneously 
believe responsible for increased agricultural im- 
ports. This will be provided, they believe, if the 
long-pending trade agreement with the British can 
be concluded in a form which will enlarge the for- 
eign market for American export crops. Here con-

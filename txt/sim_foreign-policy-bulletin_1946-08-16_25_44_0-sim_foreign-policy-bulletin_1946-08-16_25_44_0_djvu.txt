cure Russia's support at the Paris conference for 
two reasons. In the first place, Russia wishes to pre- 
vent the conference from upsetting the draft treaties 
for Eastern Europe. A survey of the membership of 
the committees which will consider the proposed 
treaties with Finland, Rumania, Bulgaria and Hun- 
gary reveals that Russia will be able to block anv 
Suggestion by these groups provided a two-thirds 
vote is required for recommendations. It appears, 
therefore, that Soviet leaders are willing to modify 
the draft treaties with the former Axis satellites, if at 
all, only in the Council of Foreign Ministers. 

The second and more important reason for Rus- 
Sia’s essentially negative attitude toward the Paris 
conference is to be found in the Soviet conviction 
that its present position in world affairs would be 
seriously weakened if any inroads were made in the 
theory of great power unanimity as the basis for 
peacemaking. To some extent this belief is un- 
doubtedly a reflection of Russia’s own dictatorial 
form of government and resulting sense of inse- 
curity both at home and abroad. But it should also 
be frankly admitted by the United States and Brit- 
ain that any reduction in the peacemaking preroga- 
tives of the great powers would almost certainly 
have different results for Russia than it would for 


Taking forcible measures to prevent further 
Jewish immigration into Palestine, Britain sealed 
off the port of Haifa on August 11 and prepared to 
deport the Jewish refugees crowded on boats in the 
harbor. The government in Whitehall issued notice 
on August 12 that it intends to maintain the status 
quo in Palestine until word is received from Wash- 
ington, members of the Jewish Agency, and Arab 
leaders about the proposal to partition the mandate. 

As yet the President and State Department have 
not announced any policy toward Palestine. But re- 
ports on August 9 indicated that Mr. Truman might 
be prepared to accept a divided Palestine if it were 
opened immediately to the 100,000 Jews, as he had 
Originally requested. Later bulletins from Washing- 
ton forecast that America would favor a partition of 
the mandate if the Jewish sector were enlarged. It 
was suggested also that the United States might con- 
tribute as much as $300,000,000 to raise the economic 
and social standards of the Arab states, $50,000,000 
being earmarked for the Arabs in Palestine. In ad- 
dition, wide latitude for Jews to control their own 
immigration would be requested under this plan. 

WIDER ISSUES AT STAKE. Whatever final de- 
cision the President makes about Palestine, he must 
bear in mind the broad scope of America’s policy in 
the Middle East. Britain is now readjusting its rela- 
tions with the Arab states and is withdrawing its 
military forces from Egypt. By partitioning the man- 
date London hopes to reduce Arab-Jewish tension

them. Since the U.S.S.R. is a newcomer on the jp. 
ternational stage and has not developed strong tig; 
with the governments of numerous small powers, 
and since the Soviet type of régime is actively feared 
in many quarters, it should be recognized that Russia 
would find itself repeatedly outvoted in any inter. 
allied meeting. Under these circumstances it is not 
surprising that Russia views any proposal to experi. 
ment with voting by an arithmetical majority as q

London of “democracy” versus “great power dicta.

there and provide areas where military installations 
may be placed within easy reach of the vital Suez | 
Canal. It is very doubtful, however, whether Britain | 
can succeed in quieting Arab-Jewish rivalries by this | 
means. Nor is it likely that Britain can thus secure 
its wider strategic aims in the Middle East. | 
The recent labor troubles in the rich oil lands of 
lower Iran have demonstrated anew that Britain’ | 
hold over the Arab world is under attack. Disputes | 
between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and its, 
workers, provoked by the Communist-dominated | 
Tudeh party, have caused London to send additional | 
military forces to the Persian Gulf within the range | 


of Iran, and roused Teheran to sharp protest. The '' 


Tudeh party has followed closely the tack which | 
Russia takes toward Britain’s policy in the Arab 
states. 

The Anglo-Soviet struggle for influence in this 
region has become clearer with every passing month | 
since the Azerbaijan revolt in northern Iran last 
fall. Turkey revealed on August 12 that Russia had | 
outlined its stand on the future control of the Dar 
danelles. The USSR demands that the Straits be reg- | 
ulated only by the states bordering on the Black 
Sea. Such a régime would give Russia a dominant 
status there, excluding both Britain and the United | 
States. America is not now a signatory to the Mon | 
treux Convention governing the Dardanelles, but | 
Turkey hopes that this country will take part in the 
future administration. Moscow has also taken 4 |

more direct interest in the Palestine issue, and on 
August 10 Izvestia charged that the British partition 
plan had but one aim, the strengthening of British 
domination in the countries of the Middle East. 

WHAT CAN THE U.S. DO? A showdown on 
Palestine appears imminent, whether or not it per- 
manently settles the controversy. London offered 
at one time to turn the mandate over to the United 
Nations. Foreign Office spokesmen have since said 
that Britain will go ahead with its own plans for 
Palestine regardless of America’s answer to the par- 
tition scheme. British officials have repeatedly asked 
America for financial and military aid in adopting 
any new approach to Palestine. Under these cir- 
cumstances, what course should the United States 
take? 

President Truman has wisely attempted to res- 
me 100,000 Jews in Europe. But while insist- 
ing on swift action to care for these displaced 
persons, America also should fully support UNRRA, 
or its successor, in making adequate arrangements 
for the other million or more stranded refugees 
in Europe. Both measures will involve considerable 
financial outlays. And if the President wishes to cut 
through the vagueness now surrounding our pol- 
icy, he will notify Congress forthwith that it will be 
asked to make such appropriations. In addition, the 
President should ask Congress to liberalize our im- 
migration rules in order to relieve the larger refugee 
roblem. 

As for Palestine’s status, the United States should 
firmly state that it is in favor of transferring the 


_ mandate to the UN Trusteeship Council, soon to be 
| organized. This move, once it is taken, will precipi- 


tate an involved struggle about the future trustee 
or trustees to be appointed. But by taking joint action 
about Palestine, the Big Three, and the Arab states 
as well, can prevent Palestine from becoming the 
source of further bitterness among them all.

Since it is probable that joint economic undertak- 
ings are necessary to stabilize the Arab lands, the 
United Nations should propose that funds be made 
available to improve health facilities, increase in- 
dustry and begin agricultural reforms. The strike 
against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company shows 
clearly that unless fundamental changes are inau- 
gurated in economically backward countries like 
Iran, Russia will continue to exploit local griev- 
ances against the Western powers. 

The United States and Britain must be largely 
responsible for such economic aid, and the recent 
indication that America is seriously considering a 
grant of $300,000,000 for rehabilitation work in 
the Middle East is one of the first signs that this 
country is facing squarely the issues involved in the 
Palestine problem. The reduction of political ten- 
sions in this area and the establishment of higher 
living standards will ultimately mean greater trad- 
ing opportunities and less likelihood that America 


will be involved in war at some future date in the 
Middle East. 


Oil resources and strategic outposts of the region 
are important to the United States as well as Britain 
or Russia. But if unilateral decisions are taken by 
each of the great powers about oil and bases in the 
Arab states, war can be the only result. If this coun- 
try wishes to lift the problem out of its present 
morass it will announce what security proposals it 
wishes to make for this area. Part of any broadly 
conceived solution for Palestine’s problem and the 
security of the Middle East must include United 
Nations military arrangements. But the United 
States has yet to urge the Security Council to out- 
line any such plans. Washington must still do so if 
this country’s policy toward the Middle East is to 
consist of more than good intentions.

END OF UNRRA POSES PROBLEM OF WORLD FOOD DISTRIBUTION 


On the world food front, the United States has 
recently made two important decisions, both of 
which reflect a desire that in the future food dis- 
tribution be handled on an individual country basis. 
Shortly before the fifth council session of the United 
Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration 
met in Geneva on August 5, the State Department 
held a series of talks with British and Canadian ofh- 
cals on the continuance of UNRRA. It was decided 
that the agency should be disbanded in Europe be- 
ginning October 1, and in the Far East by April 1. 
Those countries which have been the recipients of 
telief—Poland, Yugoslavia and Greece have re- 
ceived by far the largest share of the 13,000,000 
tons of food, medicines and supplies so far distrib- 
uted—were informed at that time by Assistant Sec- 
tetary of State William L. Clayton that the demise 


of UNRRA was impending. As further evidence of 
the new policy to move food through normal 
channels, it was announced in Washington on Au- 
gust 8 that the Cabinet had declined to endorse the 
plan of Sir John Orr, Director General of the UN 
Food and Agricultural Organization, whereby an 
international agency would be established to control 
food prices and distribute surpluses to needy nations. 

RELIEF ON A NATIONAL BASIS. The new 
United States policy was explained to the UNRRA 
Council on August 7 by Mr. Clayton, who had come 
to Geneva via Paris where he is reported to have 
discussed the political implications of the end of 
UNRRA with Secretary of State Byrnes. Mr. Clay- 
ton informed the Council that the immediate post- 
war emergency was nearly at an end, and that the 
“proper solution for any country that may require

assistance is to apply on an individual basis to an- 
other country which in its opinion is able and pre- 
pared to furnish this assistance.” He recommended 
further that a new international agency be created to 
provide for refugees and displaced persons; that the 
health work be taken over by the new World Health 
Organization; and that the World Bank be employed 
to finance some of the rehabilitation requirements. 

The decision of the United States to end its con- 
tributions to UNRRA was based in part upon the 
opinion of food experts that the current crop out- 
look in Europe is much improved. In a report issued 
on July 28, the Department of Agriculture stated 
that European crops will reach almost 90 per cent 
of their prewar average, compared to 80 per cent in 
the 1945-46 crop year. For the Far East, however, it 
was predicted that many would die of starvation be- 
fore this fall’s rice harvest; even after the harvest, 
the rice supply would still be 10 per cent short. But, 
until April 1, 1947 at least, the Chinese will con- 
tinue to receive UNRRA aid, although well-founded 
charges of inefficiency and use of supplies for politi-

scheduled to meet in Copenhagen on September 2 
at which time it will consider the proposal of Dj. 
rector General Sir John Orr to establish world cop, 
trol over food prices by “‘buffer stock operations,” 
with surpluses distributed on a relief basis. The 
United States last week, however, indicated its dis. 
approval of this plan. Washington experts fear that 
the cost of the program will be prohibitive for this 
country. But although the plan is defective for eco. 
nomic reasons, its objective is commendable —j 
seeks to avoid the errors of the interwar period 
when some areas suffered from food gluts and low 
prices, while elsewhere many people went hungy 
for want of adequate purchasing power.
